	"body": "<p>From the unique effigies of the anonymous author of this volume which graces the frontispiece, we may infer that he belongs to the exemplary class of society sometimes irreverently styled 'loafers.' He is therein represented in a garb, half sailor's, half workman's, with no superfluous appendage of coat or waistcoat, a 'wide-awake' perched jauntily on his head, one hand in his pocket and the other on his hip, with a certain air of mild defiance, and an expression of pensive insolence in his face which seems to betoken a consciousness of his mission as the 'coming man.' This view of the author is confirmed in the preface. He vouchsafes, before introducing us to his poetry, to enlighten our benighted minds as to the true function of the American poet. Evidently the original, which is embodied in the most extraordinary prose since the 'Sayings' of the modern Orpheus, was found in the 'interior consciousness' of the writer. Of the materials afforded by this country for the operations of poetic art we have a lucid account.</p> <p>The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night. Here is not merely a nation but a teeming nation of nations. Here is action untied from strings, necessarily blind to particulars and details magnificently moving in vast masses. Here is the hospitality which forever indicates heroes…Here are the roughs and beards and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the soul loves. Here the performance disdaining the trivial unapproached in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its perspective spreads with crampless and flowing breadth and showers its prolific and splendid extravagance. One sees it must indeed own the riches of the Summer and Winter, and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from the ground or the orchards drop apples or the bays contain fish or men beget children upon women.</p> <p> With veins full of such poetical stuff, the United States, as we are kindly informed, of all nations most needs poets, and will doubtless have the greatest and use them the greatest. Here is a full-length figure of the true poet:</p> <p>Of all mankind the great poet is the equable man. Not in him but off from him things are grotesque or eccentric or fail of their sanity. Nothing out of its place is good and nothing in its place is bad. He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportions, neither more nor less. He is the arbiter of the diverse and he is the key. He is the equalizer of his age and land…he supplies what wants supplying and checks what wants checking. If peace is the routine out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building vast and populous cities, encouraging agriculture and the arts and commerce—lighting the study of man, the soul, immortality—federal, state or municipal government, marriage, health, freetrade, intertravel by land and sea…nothing too close, nothing too far off…the stars not too far off. In war he is the most deadly force of the war. Who recruits him recruits horse and foot…he fetches parks of artillery the best that engineer ever knew. If the time becomes slothful and heavy he knows how to arouse it…he can make every word he speaks draw blood. Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or obedience or legislation, he never stagnates. Obedience does not master him, he masters it. High up out of reach he stands turning a concentrated light…he turns the pivot with his finger…he baffles the swiftest runners as he stands and easily overtakes and envelops them. The time straying toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by his steady faith…he spreads out his dishes…he offers the sweet firm-fibred meat that grows men and women. His brain is the ultimate brain. He is no arguer…he is judgment. He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling around a helpless thing. As he sees the farthest he has the most faith. His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things. In the talk on the soul and eternity and God off of his equal plane he is silent. He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement…he sees eternity in men and women…he does not see men and women as dreams or dots. </p> <p>Of the nature of poetry the writer discourses in a somewhat too oracular strain, especially as he has been anticipated in his 'utterances' by Emerson and other modern 'prophets of the soul':</p><p>The poetic quality is not marshaled in rhyme or uniformity or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or recitations are not independent but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough…the fact will prevail through the universe…but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost. This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, reexamine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.</p><p>Such is the poetic theory of our nameless bard. He furnishes a severe standard for the estimate of his own productions. His Leaves of Grass are doubtless intended as an illustration of the natural poet. They are certainly original in their external form, have been shaped on no pre-existent model out of the author's own brain. Indeed, his independence often becomes coarse and defiant. His language is too frequently reckless and indecent though this appears to arise from a naive unconsciousness rather than from an impure mind. His words might have passed between Adam and Eve in Paradise, before the want of fig-leaves brought no shame; but they are quite out of place amid the decorum of modern society, and will justly prevent his volume from free circulation in scrupulous circles. With these glaring faults, the Leaves of Grass are not destitute of peculiar poetic merits, which will awaken an interest in the lovers of literary curiosities. They are full of bold, stirring thoughts—with occasional passages of effective description, betraying a genuine intimacy with Nature and a keen appreciation of beauty—often presenting a rare felicity of diction, but so disfigured with eccentric fancies as to prevent a consecutive perusal without offense, though no impartial reader can fail to be impressed with the vigor and quaint beauty of isolated portions. A few specimens will suffice to give an idea of this odd genius.</p> THERES MORE HERE <p>The volume contains many more 'Leaves of Grass' of similar quality, as well as others which cannot be especially commended either for fragrance or form. Whatever severity of criticism they may challenge for their rude ingenuousness, and their frequent divergence into the domain of the fantastic, the taste of not over dainty fastidiousness will discern much of the essential spirit of poetry beneath an uncouth and grotesque embodiment.</p>",

	"body": "<p>A curious title; but the book itself is a hundred times more curious. It is like no other book that ever was written, and therefore, the language usually employed in notices of new publications is unavailable in describing it.</p><p>It is a thin volume of 95 pages, shaped like a small atlas. On the first page is a portrait of the unknown author. He stands in a careless attitude, without coat or vest, with a rough felt hat on his head, one hand thurst lazily into his pocket and the other resting on his hip. He is the picture of a perfect loafer; yet a thoughtful loafer, an amiable loafer, an able loafer. Then follows a long preface, which most steadygoing, respectable people would pronounce perfect nonsense, but which free-souled persons, here and there, will read and chuckle over with real delight, as the expression of their own best feelings. This remarkable preface is something in the Emersonian manner—that is, it is a succession of independent sentences, many of which are of striking truth and beauty. The body of the volume is filled with 'Leaves of Grass,' which are lines of rhythmical prose, or a series of utterances (we know not what else to call them), unconnected, curious, and original. The book, perhaps, might be called, American Life, from a Poetical Loafer's Point of View.</p><p>The discerning reader will find in this singular book much that will please him, and we advise all who are fond of new and peculiar things to procure it. We may add that the book was printed by the author's own hands, and that he is philosophically indifferent as to its sale. It pleased him to write so, and the public may take it or let it alone, just as they prefer.</p>",

	"body": "<p>WHITMAN'S LEAVES OF GRASS.—Our account of the last month's literature would be incomplete without some notice of a curious and lawless collection of poems, called Leaves of Grass, and issued in a thin quarto without the name of publisher or author. The poems, twelve in number, are neither in rhyme nor blank verse, but in a sort of excited prose broken into lines without any attempt at measure or regularity, and, as many readers will perhaps think, without any idea of sense or reason. The writer's scorn for the wonted usages of good writing; extends to the vocabulary he adopts; words usually banished from polite society are here employed without reserve and with perfect indifference to their effect on the reader's mind; and not only is the book one not to be read aloud to a mixed audience, but the introduction of terms, never before heard or seen, and of slang expressions, often renders an otherwise striking passage altogether laughable. But, as the writer is a new light in poetry, it is only fair to let him state his theory for himself. We extract from the preface:—</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity, and the sunlight of letters is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity—nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness***To speak in literature, with the perfect rectitude and the insouciance of the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods, is the flawless triumph of art***The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thought and things, without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or effect, or originality to hang in the way between me and the rest, like curtains. What I feel, I feel for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt, or startle, or fascinate, or soothe, I will have purposes, as health, or heat, or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my side to look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>The application of these principles, and of many others equally peculiar, which are expounded in a style equally oracular throughout the long preface,—is made passim, and often with comical success, in the poems themselves, which may briefly be described as a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy. A fireman or omnibus driver, who had intelligence enough to absorb the speculations of that school of thought which culminated at Boston some fifteen or eighteen years ago, and resources of expression to put them forth again in a form of his own, with sufficient self-conceit and contempt for public taste to affront all usual propriety of diction, might have written this gross yet elevated, this superficial yet profound, this preposterous yet somehow fascinating book. As we say, it is a mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism, and, what must be surprising to both these elements, they here seem to fuse and combine with the most perfect harmony. The vast and vague conceptions of the one, lose nothing of their quality in passing through the coarse and odd intellectual medium of the other; while there is an original perception of nature, a manly brawn, and an epic directness in our new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school. But we have no intention of regularly criticising this very irregular production; our aim is rather to cull, from the rough and ragged thicket of its pages, a few passages equally remarkable in point of thought and expression. Of course we do not select those which are the most transcendental or the most bold:—</p> <p>'I play not a march for victors only…I<br>play great marches for conquered and<br>slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain<br>the day?<br>I also say it is good to fall…battles are<br>lost in the same spirit in which they are<br>won.<br>I sound triumphal drums for the dead…<br>I fling through my embouchures the<br>loudest and gayest music to them—<br>Vivas to those who have failed, and to those<br>whose war-vessels sank in the sea, and to<br>those themselves who sank in the sea.<br>And to all generals that lost engagements,<br>and to all overcome heroes, and the number-<br>less unknown heroes equal to the<br>greatest heroes known.'<br>'I am the mashed fireman, with breast-bone<br>broken…tumbling walls buried me in<br>their debris—<br>Heat and smoke, I respired…I heard<br>the yelling shouts of my comrades—<br>I heard the distant click of their picks and<br>shovels.<br>They have cleared the beams away.…<br>they tenderly lift me forth.<br>I lie in the night air in my red shirt…<br>the pervading hush is for my sake.<br>Painless after all I lie, exhausted, but not so<br>unhappy.<br>White and beautiful are the faces around<br>me…the heads are bared of their fire-<br>caps—<br>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.'</p><p>―――</p><p> 'I tell not the fall of Alamo…not one<br>escaped to tell the fall of the Alamo:<br>The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at<br>Alamo.<br>*****<br>They were the glory of the race of rangers,<br>Matchless with a horse, a rifle, a song, a<br>supper, or a courtship:<br>Large, turbulent, brave, handsome, gener-<br>ous, proud and affectionate—<br>Bearded, sun-burnt, dressed in the free cos-<br>tume of hunters.'</p><p>―――</p><p>'Did you read in the books of the old-<br>fashioned frigate fight?<br>Did you learn who won by the light of the<br>moon and stars?<br>Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you,<br>His was the English pluck, and there is<br>no tougher or truer, and never was, and<br>never will be:<br>Along the lowered eve he came, terribly<br>raking us.<br>We close with him: the yards entangled…<br>the masts touched:<br>My captain lashed fast with his own hands.<br>We had received some eighteen-pound<br>shots under the water—<br>On our lower gun-deck two large pieces<br>had burst at the first fire, killing all<br>around and blowing up, overhead.<br>Ten o'clock at night and the full moon shin-<br>ing, and the leaks on the gain, and five<br>feet of water reported;<br>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners in<br>the after-hold, to give them a chance for<br>themselves.<br>The transit to and from the magazine was<br>now stopped by the sentinels—<br>They saw so many strange faces, they did<br>not know whom to trust.<br>Our frigate was a-fire—the other asked if<br>we demanded quarters? if our colors were<br>struck and the fighting done?<br>I laughed content when I heard the voice<br>of my little captain—<br>`We have not struck,' he composedly cried.<br>`We have just begun our part of the<br>fighting.'<br>Only three guns were in use.<br>One was directed by the captain himself,<br>against the enemy's mainmast:<br>Two, well served with grape and canister,<br>silenced his musketry and cleared his<br>decks.<br>*****<br>Not a moment's cease —<br>The leaks gained fast on the pumps…the fire eat toward the<br>powder magazine:<br>One of the pumps was shot away; it was generally thought we<br>were sinking.<br>Serene stood the little captain:<br>He was not hurried…his voice was neither high or low—<br>His eyes gave more light to us than our battle-lanterns.<br>Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they<br>surrendered to us.'</p><p>―――</p><p>'As to you, life, I reckon you are the leav-<br>ings of many deaths:<br>No doubt I have died myself ten thousand<br>times before.<br>I hear you whispering there, O stars of<br>heaven—<br>O suns!

This, no doubt, is upon the principle that the name is merely accidental; while the portrait affords an idea of the essential being from whom these utterances proceed. We must add, however, that this significant reticence does not prevail throughout the volume, for we learn on p. 29, that our poet is 'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos.' That he was an American, we knew before, for, aside from America, there is no quarter of the universe where such a production could have had a genesis. That he was one of the roughs was also tolerably plain; but that he was a kosmos, is a piece of news we were hardly prepared for. Precisely what a kosmos is, we trust Mr. Whitman will take an early occasion to inform the impatient public.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman and His Poems",
	"body": "<p>AN American bard at last! One of the roughs, large, proud, affectionate, eating, drinking, and breeding, his costume manly and free, his face sunburnt and bearded, his posture strong and erect, his voice bringing hope and prophecy to the generous races of young and old. We shall cease shamming and be what we really are. We shall start an athletic and defiant literature. We realize now how it is, and what was most lacking. The interior American republic shall also be declared free and independent.</p><p>For all our intellectual people, followed by their books, poems, novels, essays, editorials, lectures, tuitions, and criticism, dress by London and Paris modes, receive what is received there, obey the authorities, settle disputes by the old tests, keep out of rain and sun, retreat to the shelter of houses and schools, trim their hair, shave, touch not the earth barefoot, and enter not the sea except in a complete bathing-dress. One sees unmistakably genteel persons, travelled, college-learned, used to be served by servants, conversing without heat or vulgarity, supported on chairs, or walking through handsomely-carpeted parlors, or along shelves bearing well-bound volumes, and walls adorned with curtained and collared portraits, and china things, and nick-nacks. But where in American literature is the first show of America? Where are the gristle and beards, and broad breasts, and space and ruggedness and nonchalance that the souls of the people love? Where is the tremendous outdoors of these States? Where is the majesty of the federal mother, seated with more than antique grace, calm, just, indulgent to her brood of children, calling them around her regarding the little and the large and the younger and the older with perfect impartiality? Where is the vehement growth of our cities? Where is the spirit of the strong rich life of the American mechanic, farmer, sailor, hunter, and miner? Where is the huge composite of all other nations, cast in a fresher and brawnier matrix, passing adolescence, and needed this day, live and arrogant, to lead the marches of the world?</p><p>Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all the attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature, talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such a being as a writer. Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior. Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of the old theories and forms. Every phrase announces new laws; not once do his lips unclose except in conformity with them. With light and rapid touch he first indicates in prose the principles of the foundation of a race of poets so deeply to spring from the American people, and become ingrained through them, that their Presidents shall not be the common referees so much as that great race of poets shall. He proceeds himself to exemplify this new school, and set models for their expression and range of subjects. He makes audacious and native use of his own body and soul. He must re-create poetry with the elements always at hand. He must imbue it with himself as he is, disorderly, fleshy, and sensual, a lover of things, yet a lover of men and women above the whole of the other objects of the universe. His work is to be achieved by unusual methods. Neither classic or romantic is he, nor a materialist any more than a spiritualist. Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk and rhyme of poetry—not the first recognition of gods or goddesses, or Greece or Rome. No breath of Europe, or her monarchies, or priestly conventions, or her notions of gentlemen and ladies founded on the idea of caste, seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs. But in their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age, and the realities of this mighty continent, and the sciences and inventions and discoveries of the present world. Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor physiology, nor engineering, is more true to itself than Walt Whitman is true to them. They and the other sciences underlie his whole superstructure. In the beauty of the work of the poet, he affirms, are the tuft and final applause of science.</p><p>Affairs then are this man's poems. He will still inject nature through civilization. The movement of his verses is the sweeping movement of great currents of living people, with a general government, and state and municipal governments, courts, commerce, manufactures, arsenals, steamships, railroads, telegraphs, cities with paved streets, and aqueducts, and police and gas—myriads of travellers arriving and departing—newspapers, music, elections and all the features and processes of the nineteenth century in the wholesomest race and the only stable form of politics at present upon the earth. Along his words spread the broad impartialities of the United States. No innovations must be permitted on the stern severities of our liberty and equality. Undecked also is this poet with sentimentalism, or jingle, or nice conceits or flowery similes. He appears in his poems surrounded by women and children, and by young men, and by common objects and qualities. He gives to each just what belongs to it, neither more or less. The person nearest him, that person he ushers hand in hand with himself. Duly take places in his flowing procession, and step to the sounds of the newer and larger music, the essences of American things, and past and present events—the enormous diversity of temperature and agriculture and mines—the tribes of red aborigines—the weather-beaten vessels entering new ports, or making landings on rocky coasts—the first settlements north and south—the rapid stature and impatience of outside control—the sturdy defiance of '76, and the war and peace, and the leadership of Washington, and the formation of the Constitution—the Union always calm and impregnable—the perpetual coming of immigrants—the wharf-hemmed cities and superior marine—the unsurveyed interior—the log-house, and clearings, and wild animals, and hunters, and trappers—the fisheries, and whaling, and gold-digging—the endless gestation of new states—the convening of Congress every December, the members coming up from all climates, and from the utter-most parts—the noble character of the free American workman and workwoman—the fierceness of the people when well-roused—the ardor of their friendships—the large amativeness—the Yankee swap—the New York fireman, and the target excursion—the southern plantation life—the character of the north-east, and of the north-west and south-west—and the character of America and the American people everywhere. For these the old usages of poets afford Walt Whitman no means sufficiently fit and free, and he rejects the old usages. The style of the bard that is waited for is to be transcendent and new. It is to be indirect and not direct or descriptive or epic. Its quality is to go through these to much more. Let the age and wars (he says) of other nations be chanted, and their eras and characters be illustrated, and that finish the verse. Not so (he continues) the great psalm of the republic. Here the theme is creative and has vista. Here comes one among the well-beloved stonecutters, and announces himself, and plans with decision and science, and sees the solid and beautiful forms of the future where there are now no solid forms.</p><p>The style of these poems, therefore, is simply their own style, new-born and red. Nature may have given the hint to the author of the 'Leaves of Grass', but there exists no book or fragment of a book, which can have given the hint to them. All beauty, he says, comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. His rhythm and uniformity he will conceal in the roots of his verses, not to be seen of themselves, but to break forth loosely as lilies on a bush, and take shapes compact as the shapes of melons, or chestnuts, or pears.</p><p>The poems of the 'Leaves of Grass' are twelve in number. Walt Whitman at first proceeds to put his own body and soul into the new versification:<p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>He leaves houses and their shuttered rooms, for the open air. He drops disguise and ceremony, and walks forth with the confidence and gayety of a child. For the old decorums of writing he substitutes new decorums. The first glance out of his eyes electrifies him with love and delight. He will have the earth receive and return his affection; he will stay with it as the bride-groom stays with the bride. The cool-breathed ground, the slumbering and liquid trees, the just-gone sunset, the vitreous pour of the full moon, the tender and growing night, he salutes and touches, and they touch him. The sea supports him, and hurries him off with its powerful and crooked fingers. Dash me with amorous wet! then he says, I can repay you.</p><p>By this writer the rules of polite circles are dismissed with scorn. Your stale modesties, he says, are filthy to such a man as I.</p><p>'I believe in the flesh and the appetites,<br>Seeing, hearing, and feeling are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.<br>I do not press my finger across my mouth,<br>I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart.'</p><p>No sniveller, or tea-drinking poet, no puny clawback or prude, is Walt Whitman. He will bring poems fit to fill the days and nights—fit for men and women with the attributes of throbbing blood and flesh. The body, he teaches, is beautiful. Sex is also beautiful. Are you to be put down, he seems to ask, to that shallow level of literature and conversation that stops a man's recognizing the delicious pleasure of his sex, or a woman hers? Nature he proclaims inherently pure. Sex will not be put aside; it is a great ordination of the universe. He works the muscle of the male and the teeming fibre of the female throughout his writings, as wholesome realities, impure only by deliberate intention and effort. To men and women he says: You can have healthy and powerful breeds of children on no less terms than these of mine. Follow me and there shall be taller and nobler crops of humanity on the earth.</p><p>In the 'Leaves of Grass' are the facts of eternity and immortality, largely treated. Happiness is no dream, and perfection is no dream. Amelioration is my lesson, he says with calm voice, and progress is my lesson and the lesson of all things. Then his persuasion becomes a taunt, and his love bitter and compulsory. With strong and steady call he addresses men. Come, he seems to say, from the midst of all that you have been your whole life surrounding yourself with. Leave all the preaching and teaching of others, and mind only these words of mine.</p><p>'Long enough have you dreamed contemptible dreams,<br>Now I wash the gum from your eyes,<br>You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your<br>life.<br>Long have you timidly waded, holding a plank by the shore,<br>Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,<br>To jump off in the midst of the sea, and rise again and nod to me and shout, and<br>laughingly dash with your hair.<br>I am the teacher of athletes,<br>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,<br>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.<br>The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own<br>right,<br>Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br>Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than a wound cuts,<br>First rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff; to sing or play<br>on the banjo,<br>Preferring scars and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers and those that<br>keep out of the sun.<br>I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?<br>I follow you whoever you are from the present hour;<br>My words itch at your ears till you understand them.<br>I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat;<br>It is you talking just as much as myself—I act as the tongue of you.<br>It was tied in your mouth—in mine it begins to be loosened.<br>I swear I will never mention love or death inside a house,<br>And I swear I never will translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately<br>stays with me in the open air.'</p><p>The eleven other poems have each distinct purposes, curiously veiled. Theirs is no writer to be gone through with in a day or a month. Rather it is his pleasure to elude you and provoke you for deliberate purposes of his own.</p><p>Doubtless in the scheme this man has built for himself the writing of poems is but a proportionate part of the whole. It is plain that public and private performance, politics, love, friendship, behavior, the art of conversation, science, society, the American people, the reception of the great novelties of city and country, all have their equal call upon him and receive equal attention. In politics he could enter with the freedom and reality he shows in poetry. His scope of life is the amplest of any yet in philosophy. He is the true spiritualist. He recognizes no annihilation, or death, or loss of identity. He is the largest lover and sympathizer that has appeared in literature. He loves the earth and sun, and the animals. He does not separate the learned from the unlearned, the Northerner from the Southerner, the white from the black, or the native from the immigrant just landed at the wharf. Every one, he seems to say, appears excellent to me, every employment is adorned, and every male and female glorious.</p><p>'The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,<br>They scorn the best I can do to relate them.<br>I am enamored of growing out-doors,<br>Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,<br>Of the builders and steerers of ships, of the wielders of axes and mauls, of the<br>drivers of horses,<br>I can eat and sleep with them, week in and week out.<br>What is commonest and cheapest and nearest and easiest is Me,<br>Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,<br>Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,<br>Not asking the sky to come down to my good will.<br>Scattering it freely for ever.'</p><p>If health were not his distinguishing attribute, this poet would be the very harlot of persons. Right and left he flings his arms, drawing men and women with undeniable love to his close embrace, loving the clasp of their hands, the touch of their necks and breasts, and the sound of their voice. All else seems to burn up under his fierce affection for persons. Politics, religion, institutions, art, quickly fall aside before them. In the whole universe, he says, I see nothing more divine than human souls.</p><p>'When the psalm sings instead of singer,<br>When the script preaches instead of the preacher,<br>When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the support-<br>ing desk,<br>When the sacred vessels or the bits of the eucharist, or the lath and plast, procre-<br>ate as effectually as the young silversmiths or bakers, or the masons in their<br>overalls,<br>When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince,<br>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's daughter,<br>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly companions,<br>I intend to reach them my hand and make as much of them as I make of men and<br>women.'</p><p>Who then is that insolent unknown? Who is it, praising himself as if others were not fit to do it, and coming rough and unbidden among writers to unsettle what was settled, and to revolutionize, in fact, our modern civilization? Walt Whitman was born on Long-Island, on the hills about thirty miles from the greatest American city, on the last day of May, 1819, and has grown up in Brooklyn and New York to be thirty-six years old, to enjoy perfect health, and to understand his country and its spirit.</p><p>Interrogations more than this, and that will not be put off unanswered, spring continually through the perusal of these Leaves of Grass:</p><p>If there were to be selected, out of the incalculable volumes of printed matter in existence, any single work to stand for America and her times, should this be the work?</p><p>Must not the true American poet indeed absorb all others, and present a new and far more ample and vigorous type?</p><p>Has not the time arrived for a school of live writing and tuition consistent with the principles of these poems? consistent with the free spirit of this age, and with the American truths of politics? consistent with geology, and astronomy, and all science and human physiology? consistent with the sublimity of immortality and the directness of common-sense?</p><p>If in this poem the United States have found their poetic voice, and taken measure and form, is it any more than a beginning? Walt Whitman himself disclaims singularity in his work, and announces the coming after him of great successions of poets, and that he but lifts his finger to give the signal.</p><p>Was he not needed? Has not literature been bred in and in long enough? Has it not become unbearably artificial?</p><p>Shall a man of faith and practice in the simplicity of real things be called eccentric, while the disciple of the fictitious school writes without question?</p><p>hall it still be the amazement of the light and dark that freshness of expression is the rarest quality of all?</p><p>You have come in good time, Walt Whitman! In opinions, in manners, in costumes, in books, in the aims and occupancy of life, in associates, in poems, conformity to all unnatural and tainted customs passes without remark, while perfect naturalness, health, faith, self-reliance, and all primal expressions of the manliest love and friendship, subject one to the stare and controversy of the world.</p>",

	"title": "'Leaves of Grass'—An Extraordinary Book",
	"body": "<p>Here we have a book which fairly staggers us. It sets all the ordinary rules of criticism at defiance. It is one of the strangest compounds of transcendentalism, bombast, philosophy, folly, wisdom, wit and dullness which it ever entered into the heart of man to conceive. Its author is Walter Whitman, and the book is a reproduction of the author. His name is not on the frontispiece, but his portrait, half length, is. The contents of the book form a daguerreotype of his inner being, and the title page bears a representation of its physical tabernacle. It is a poem; but it conforms to none of the rules by which poetry has ever been judged. It is not an epic nor an ode, nor a lyric; nor does its verses move with the measured pace of poetical feet—of Iambic, Trochaic or Anapaestic, nor seek the aid of Amphibrach, of dactyl or Spondee, nor of final or cesural pause, except by accident. But we had better give Walt's own conception of what a poet of the age and country should be. We quote from the preface:</p><p>'Other States indicate themselves in their deputies, but the genius of the United States is not best or most in executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors, or colleges, or churches, or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors; but always most in the common people, their manners, speech, dress, friendship—the friendship and candor of their physiognomy—the picturesque looseness of their carriage—their deathless attachment to freedom—their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft or mean, the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of all other States—the fierceness of their roused resentments—their curiosity and welcome of novelty—their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy—their susceptibility of a slight—the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors—the fluency of their speech—their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul—their good temper and open handedness—the terrible significance of their elections—the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him—these too are unrhymed poetry.'</p><p>But the poetry which the author contemplates must reflect the nation as well as the people themselves.</p><p>'His spirit responds to his country's spirit; he incarnates its geography and natural life, and rivers and lakes. Mississippi with annual freshets and changing chutes, Missouri, and Columbia, and Ohio, and the beautiful masculine Hudson, do not embouchure where they spend themselves more than they embouchure into him. The blue breadth over the inland sea of Virginia and Maryland, and the sea of Massachusetts and Maine, over Manhattan Bay, and over Champlain and Erie, and over Ontario and Huron, and Michigan and Superior, and over the Texan, and Mexican, and Floridian and Cuban seas, and over the seas of California and Oregon, is not tallied by the blue breadth of the waters below more than the breadth of above and below is tallied by him.</p><p>. . . 'To him enter the essence of the real things, and past and present events—of the enormous diversity of temperature, and agriculture, and mines—the tribes of red aborigines—the weather-beaten vessels entering new ports or making landings on rocky coasts—the first settlement North and South—the rapid stature and muscle—the haughty defiance of '76, and the war, and peace, and formation of the constitution —the union surrounded by blatherers, and always impregnable—the perpetual coming of immigrants—the wharf-hemmed cities and superior marine—the unsurveyed interior—the log houses, and clearings, and wild animals, and hunters, and trappers—the free commerce, the fishing, and whaling, and gold digging—the endless gestation of new States—the convening of Congress every December, the members duly coming up from all climates and the uttermost parts—the noble character of the young mechanics, and of all free American workmen and workwomen—the general ardor, and friendliness, and enterprise—the perfect equality of the female with the male—the large amativeness—the fluid movement of the population,' &c.**</p><p>'For such the expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and new.'</p><p>And the poem seems to accord with the ideas here laid down. No drawing room poet is the author of the 'Leaves of Grass;' he prates not of guitar thrumming under ladies' windows, nor deals in the extravagances of sentimentalism; no pretty conceits or polished fancies are tacked together 'like orient pearls at random strung;' but we have the free utterance of an untramelled spirit without the slightest regard to established models or fixed standards of taste. His scenery presents no shaven lawns or neatly trimmed arbors; no hot house conservatory, where delicate exotics odorise the air and enchant the eye. If we follow the poet we must scale unknown precipices and climb untrodden mountains; or we boat on nameless lakes, encountering probably rapids and waterfalls, and start wild fowls never classified by Wilson or Audubon; or we wander among primeval forests, now pressing the yielding surface of velvet moss, and anon caught among thickets and brambles. He believes in the ancient philosophy that there is no more real beauty or merit in one particle of matter than another; he appreciates all; every thing is right that is in its place, and everything is wrong that is not in its place. He is guilty, not only of breaches of conventional decorum but treats with nonchalant defiance what goes by the name of refinement and delicacy of feeling and expression. Whatever is natural he takes to his heart; whatever is artificial (in the frivolous sense) he makes of no account. The following description of himself is more truthful than many self-drawn pictures:</p><p>'Apart from the pulling and hauling, stands what I<br>am,<br>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle,<br>unitary,<br>Looks down, is erect, bends an arm on an impalpa-<br>ble certain rest,<br>Looks with its side-curved head curious, what will<br>come next,<br>Both in and out of the game, and watching and won-<br>dering at it.'</p><p>As a poetic interpretation of nature, we believe the following is not surpassed in the range of poetry:</p><p>'A child said, What is grass! fetching it to me with full<br>hands;<br>How could I answer the child! I do not know any<br>more than he.<br>I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord;<br>A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly drop-<br>ped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway on the corners,<br>that we may see, and remark, and say, Whose?</p><p>We are afforded glimpses of half-formed pictures to tease and tantalize with their indistinctness: like a crimson cheek and flashing eye looking on us through the leaves of an arbor—mocking us for a moment, but vanishing before we can reach them. Here is an example:</p><p>'Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;<br>Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly.<br>Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lone-<br>some.<br>She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;<br>She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds<br>of the window.<br>Which of the young men does she like the best?<br>Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.<br>Dancing and laughing along the beach came the<br>twenty-ninth bather;<br>The rest did not see her, but she saw them, &c.'</p><p>Well, did the lady fall in love with the twenty-ninth bather, or vice versa? Our author scorns to gratify such puerile curiosity; the denouement which novel readers would expect is not hinted at.</p><p>In his philosophy justice attains its proper dimensions:</p><p>'I play not a march for victors only: I play great<br>marches for conquered and slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say that it is good to fall—battles are lost in<br>the same spirit in which they are won.<br>I sound triumphal drums for the dead—I fling thro'<br>my embouchures the loudest and gayest music<br>for them.<br>Vivas to those who have failed and to those whose<br>war vessels sank in the sea.<br>And to those themselves who sank into the sea.<br>And to all generals that lost engagements, and all<br>overcome heroes and the numberless unknown<br>heroes equal to the greatest heroes known.'</p><p>The triumphs of victors had been duly celebrated, but surely a poet was needed to sing the praises of the defeated whose cause was righteous, and the heroes who have been trampled under the hoofs of iniquity's onward march.</p><p>He does not pick and choose sentiments and expressions fit for general circulation—he gives a voice to whatever is, whatever we see, and hear, and think, and feel. He descends to grossness, which debars the poem from being read aloud in any mixed circle. We have said that the work defies criticism; we pronounce no judgment upon it; it is a work that will satisfy few upon a first perusal; it must be read again and again, and then it will be to many unaccountable. All who read it will agree that it is an extraordinary book, full of beauties and blemishes, such as nature is to those who have only a half formed acquaintance with her mysteries.</p>",

	"body": "<p>[We have received from a correspondent the following comparative and critical review of two poems recently published, both of which may be had at this office, or by mail, postage prepaid, at prices annexed.]</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS: Poems by WALT WHITMAN Brooklyn: 1855. 1 vol. quarto. Price $1 25.</p><p>MAUD, and other Poems By ALFRED TENNYSON. London: 1855. Price $1 25.</p><p>It is always reserved for second-rate poems immediately to gratify. As first-rate or natural objects, in their perfect simplicity and proportion, do not startle or strike, but appear no more than matters of course, so probably natural poetry does not, for all its being the rarest, and telling of the longest and largest work. The artist or writer whose talent is to please the connoisseurs of his time, may obey the laws of his time, and achieve the intense and elaborated beauty of parts. The perfect poet cannot afford any special beauty of parts, or to limit himself by any laws less than those universal ones of the great masters, which include all times, and all men and women, and the living and the dead. For from the study of the universe is drawn this irrefragable truth, that the law of the requisites of a grand poem, or any other complete workmanship, is originality, and the average and superb beauty of the ensemble. Possessed with this law, the fitness of aim, time, persons, places, surely follows. Possessed with this law, and doing justice to it, no poet or any one else will make anything ungraceful or mean, any more than any emanation of nature is.</p><p>The poetry of England, by the many rich geniuses of that wonderful little island, has grown out of the facts of the English race, the monarchy and aristocracy prominent over the rest, and conforms to the spirit of them. No nation ever did or ever will receive with national affection any poets except those born of its national blood. Of these, the writings express the finest infusions of government, traditions, faith, and the dependence or independence of a people, and even the good or bad physiognomy, and the ample or small geography. Thus what very properly fits a subject of the British crown may fit very ill an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect, is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; everything receives its tinge from that. In the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakspeare just as much as the rest, there is the air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakspeare, represented in America, is not an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone never silent in their plots and characters be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson was the most enormous of liars, and common persons,north and south, should bow low to their betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops.</p><p>English versification is full of these danglers, and America follows after them. Every body writes poetry, and yet there is not a single poet. An age greater than the proudest of the past is swiftly slipping away, without one lyric voice to seize its greatness, and speak it as an encouragement and onward lesson. We have heard, by many grand announcements, that he was to come, but will he come?</p><p>'A mighty Poet whom this age shall choose<br>To be its spokesman to all coming times.<br>In the ripe full-blown season of his soul,<br>He shall go forward in his spirit's strength,<br>And grapple with the questions of all time,<br>And wring from them their meanings. As King Saul<br>Called up the buried prophet from his grave<br>To speak his doom, so shall this Poet-king<br>Call up the dread past from its awful grave<br>To tell him of our future. As the air<br>Doth sphere the world, so shall his heart of love—<br>Loving mankind, not peoples. As the lake<br>Reflects the flower, tree, rock, and bending heaven,<br>Shall he reflect our great humanity;<br>And as the young Spring breathes with living breath<br>On a dead branch, till it sprouts fragrantly<br>Green leaves and sunny flowers, shall he breathe life<br>Through every theme he touch, making all Beauty<br>And Poetry forever like the stars.'—Alexander Smith.</p><p>The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy, and their combination into love. This love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakspeare the same as the rest. It is possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connection with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female.</p><p>Poetry, to Tennyson and his British and American eleves, is a gentleman of the first degree, boating, fishing, and shooting genteelly through nature, admiring the ladies, and talking to them, in company, with that elaborate half-choked deference that is to be made up by the terrible license of men among themselves. The spirit of the burnished society of upper-class England fills this writer and his effusions from top to toe. Like that, he does not ignore courage and the superior qualities of men, but all is to show forth through dandified forms. He meets the nobility and gentry half-way. The models are the same both to the poet and the parlors. Both have the same supercilious elegance, both love the reminiscences which extol caste, both agree on the topics proper for mention and discussion, both hold the same undertone of church and state, both have the same languishing melancholy and irony, both indulge largely in persiflage, both are marked by the contour of high blood and a constitutional aversion to anything cowardly and mean, both accept the love depicted in romances as the great business of a life as a poem, both seem unconscious of the mighty truths of eternity and immortality, both are silent on the presumptions of liberty and equality, and both devour themselves in solitary lassitude. Whatever may be said of all this, it harmonizes and represents facts. The present phases of high-life in Great Britain are as natural a growth there, as Tennyson and his poems are a natural growth of those phases. It remains to be distinctly admitted that this man is a real first-class poet, infused amid all that ennui and aristocracy.</p><p>Meanwhile a strange voice parts others aside and demands for its owner that position that is only allowed after the seal of many returning years has stamped with approving stamp the claims of the loftiest leading genius. Do you think the best honors of the earth are won so easily, Walt Whitman? Do you think city and country are to fall before the vehement egotism of your recitative of yourself?</p><p>'I am the poet of the body,<br>And I am the poet of the soul.<br>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell<br>are with me,<br>The first I graft and increase upon myself…the latter I<br>translate into a new tongue.<br>I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br>And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,<br>And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.<br>I chant a new chant of dilation or pride,<br>We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,<br>I show that size is only development.'</p><p>It is indeed a strange voice! Critics and lovers and readers of poetry as hitherto written, may well be excused the chilly and unpleasant shudders which will assuredly run through them, to their very blood and bones, when they first read Walt Whitman's poems. If this is poetry, where must its foregoers stand? And what is at once to become of the ranks of rhymesters, melancholy and swallow-tailed, and of all the confectioners and upholsterers of verse, if the tan-faced man here advancing and claiming to speak for America and the nineteenth hundred of the Christian list of years, typifies indeed the natural and proper bard?</p><p>'The friendly and flowing savage. Who is he?<br>Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?<br>Is he some south-westerner raised outdoors? Is he Canadian?<br>Is he from the Mississippi country? or from Iowa, Oregon,<br>or California? or from the mountains? or prairie-life or<br>bush-life? or from the sea?<br>Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,<br>They desire he should like them and touch them and speak<br>to them and stay with them.<br>Behaviour lawless as snow-flakes—words simple as grass—<br>uncombed head and laughter and naivete;<br>Slowstepping feet and the common features, and the com<br>mon modes and emanations,<br>They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,<br>They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath…<br>they fly out of the glance of his eyes.'</p><p>Not a borrower from other lands, but a prodigal user of his own land is Walt Whitman. Not the refined life of the drawing-room—not dancing and polish and gentility, but some powerful uneducated person, and some harsh identity of sound, and all wild free forms, are grateful to him. A thrill of his own likeness strikes him as the spotted hawk wheels noisily near his head at nightfall, and he is fain to say,</p><p>'I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>He is sterile on the old myths, and on all the customary themes of romantic and classical writers, but pregnant with the deductions of the geologist, the astronomer, the great antiquary, the chemist, the phrenologist, the spiritualist, the mathematician, and with the ideas and practice of American politics. Individuals and personal incidents are not given by him at second-hand: he himself assumes and becomes any character, one after another—the child uttering fancies about the grass—the curious meditator reclining on a bank of a summer forenoon, and holding a long colloquy of love with his own soul—the friendly mate and companion of people—now riding from the fields atop of the load of hay on its way to the barn—or in the most crowded rush of a great city—or hunting alone over the mountains or far in the wilds—sailing in the Yankee clipper under her three skysails—one of a chowder-party with boatmen or clam-diggers—giving shelter to the runaway slave—beholding the marriage of the trapper to the red girl in the far west—or bathing with bathers by the sea-side—absorbing all pleasures and all pains—learning lessons of animals and birds—merged in any affair or person—in the carpenter dressing his plank—the pilot who seizes the kingpin of the wheel—the driver who drives the dray of the stone-yard—the spinning girl advancing forward and retreating backward—the canal-boy on the tow-path—the pavior with his wooden beetle—the drover singing out to his drove—the Wolverine setting traps by the Huron—the Missourian crossing the plains with his wares and his cattle—the flatboatman making fast at night near the shores of cottonwood and pekan-tree—the hunter and trapper resting after their day's sport in the hut of adobe—the mourning widow looking out on the winter midnight—the Yankee or the Texan—the Georgian, the lumberer of Maine, the Kentuckian, Ohian, Louisianian, or Californian—mechanic, author, artist or shoolboy—thinker of the thoughts of all men in all ages—appreciator of the nearest and readiest, and traveller from the most distant and diverse.</p><p>The theory and practice of poets have hitherto been to select certain ideas or events or personages, and then describe them in the best manner they could, always with as much ornament as the case allowed. Such are not the theory and practice of the new poet. He never presents for perusal a poem ready-made on the old models, and ending when you come to the end of it; but every sentence and every passage tells of an interior not always seen, and exudes an impalpable something which sticks to him that reads, and pervades and provokes him to tread the half-invisible road where the poet, like an apparition, is striding fearlessly before. If Walt Whitman's premises are true, then there is a subtler range of poetry than that of the grandeur of acts and events, as in Homer, or of characters, as in Shakspeare—poetry to which all other writing is subservient, and which confronts the very meanings of the works of nature and competes with them. It is the direct bringing of occurrences and persons and things to bear on the listener or beholder, to re-appear through him or her; and it offers the best way of making them a part of him and her as the right aim of the greatest poet.</p><p>Of the spirit of life in visible forms—of the spirit of the seed growing out of the ground—of the spirit of the resistless motion of the globe passing unsuspected but quick as lightning along its orbit—of them is the spirit of this man's poetry. Like them it eludes and mocks criticism, and appears unerringly in results. Things, facts, events, persons, days, ages, qualities, tumble pell-mell, exhaustless and copious, with what appear to be the same disregard of parts, and the same absence of special purpose, as in nature. But the voice of the few rare and controlling critics, and the voice of more than one generation of men, or two generations of men, must speak for the inexpressible purposes of nature, and for this haughtiest of writers that has ever yet written and printed a book. He is to prove either the most lamentable of failures or the most glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature. And after all we have written we confess our brain-felt and heart-felt inability to decide which we think it is likely to be.</p>",

	"title": "Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)",
	"body": "<p>By Walt Whitman. Leaves of Grass 1855.</p><p>An unconsidered letter of introduction has oftentimes procured the admittance of a scurvy fellow into good society, and our apology for permitting any allusion to the above volume in our columns is, that it has been unworthily recommended by a gentleman of wide repute, and might, on that account, obtain access to respectable people, unless its real character were exposed.</p><p>Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson either recognises and accepts these 'leaves,' as the gratifying results of his own peculiar doctrines, or else he has hastily endorsed them, after a partial and superficial reading. If it is of any importance, he may extricate himself from the dilemma. We, however, believe that this book does express the bolder results of a certain transcendental kind of thinking, which some have styled philosophy.</p><p>As to the volume itself, we have only to remark, that it strongly fortifies the doctrines of the Metempsychosists, for it is impossible to imagine how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth, unless he were possessed of the soul of a sentimental donkey that had died of disappointed love. This poet (?) without wit, but with a certain vagrant wildness, just serves to show the energy which natural imbecility is occasionally capable of under strong excitement.</p><p>There are too many persons, who imagine they demonstrate their superiority to their fellows, by disregarding all the politenesses and decencies of life, and, therefore, justify themselves in indulging the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license. But nature, abhorring the abuse of the capacities she has given to man, retaliates upon him, by rendering extravagant indulgence in any direction followed by an insatiable, ever-consuming, and never to be appeased passion.</p><p>Thus, to these pitiful beings, virtue and honor are but names. Bloated with self-conceit, they strut abroad unabashed in the daylight, and expose to the world the festering sores that overlay them like a garment. Unless we admit this exhibition to be beautiful, we are at once set down for non-progressive conservatives, destitute of the 'inner light,' the far-seeingness which, of course, characterize those gifted individuals. Now, any one who has noticed the tendency of thought in these later years, must be aware that a quantity of this kind of nonsense is being constantly displayed. The immodesty of presumption exhibited by these seers; their arrogant pretentiousness; the complacent smile with which they listen to the echo of their own braying, should be, and we believe is, enough to disgust the great majority of sensible folks; but, unfortunately, there is a class that, mistaking sound for sense, attach some importance to all this rant and cant. These candid, these ingenuous, these honest 'progressionists;' these human diamonds without flaws; these men that have come, detest furiously all shams; 'to the pure, all things are pure;' they are pure, and, consequently, must thrust their reeking presence under every man's nose.</p><p>They seem to think that man has no instinctive delicacy; is not imbued with a conservative and preservative modesty, that acts as a restraint upon the violence of passions, which, for a wise purpose, have been made so strong. No! these fellows have no secrets, no disguises; no, indeed! But they do have, conceal it by whatever language they choose, a degrading, beastly sensuality, that is fast rotting the healthy core of all the social virtues.</p><p>There was a time when licentiousness laughed at reproval; now it writes essays and delivers lectures. Once it shunned the light; now it courts attention, writes books showing how grand and pure it is, and prophesies from its lecherous lips its own ultimate triumph.</p><p>Shall we argue with such men? Shall we admit them into our houses, that they may leave a foul odor, contaminate the pure, healthful air? Or shall they be placed in the same category with the comparatively innocent slave of poverty, ignorance and passion, that skulks along in the shadows of by-ways; even in her deep degradation possessing some sparks of the Divine light, the germ of good that reveals itself by a sense of shame?</p><p>Thus, then, we leave this gathering of muck to the laws which, certainly, if they fulfil their intent, must have power to suppress such gross obscenity. As it is entirely destitute of wit, there is no probability that any one would, after this exposure, read it in the hope of finding that; and we trust no one will require further evidence—for, indeed, we do not believe there is a newspaper so vile that would print confirmatory extracts.</p><p>In our allusions to this book, we have found it impossible to convey any, even the most faint idea of its style and contents, and of our disgust and detestation of them, without employing language that cannot be pleasing to ears polite; but it does seem that some one should, under circumstances like these, undertake a most disagreeable, yet stern duty. The records of crime show that many monsters have gone on in impunity, because the exposure of their vileness was attended with too great indelicacy. 'Peccatum illud horribile, inter Christianos non nominandum.' </p>",

	"title": "Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)",
	"body": "<p>Carlyle represents a contemporary reviewer taking leave of the Belles-Lettres department somewhat in this abrupt manner:</p><p>The end having come, it is fit that we end—Poetry having ceased to be read, or published, or written, how can it continue to be reviewed? With your Lake Schools, and Border-Thief Schools, and Cockney and Satanic Schools, there has been enough to do; and now, all these Schools having been burnt or smouldered themselves out, and left nothing but a wide-spread wreck of ashes, dust, and cinders—or perhaps dying embers, kicked to and fro under the feet of innumerable women and children in the magazines, and at best blown here and there into transient sputters, what remains but to adjust ourselves to circumstances? Urge me not, [continues this desperate litterateur] with considerations that Poetry, as the inward Voice of Life, must be perennial; only dead in one form to become alive in another; that this still abundant deluge of Metre, seeing there must needs be fractions of Poetry floating, scattered in it, ought still to be net-fished; at all events, surveyed and taken note of. The survey of English metre, at this epoch, perhaps transcends the human faculties; to hire out the reading of it by estimate, at a remunerative rate per page, would, in a few quarters, reduce the cash-box of any extant review to the verge of insolvency.</p><p>Such is the humorous but essentially truthful picture of the condition and product of the creative faculties during the second quarter of the present century. The great poets, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Goethe, and Schiller, had fulfilled their tasks and gone to other spheres; and all that remained with few exceptions, were weak and feeble echoes of their dying strains, caught up and repeated by numerous imitators and pretenders. And so has it ever been; the visions and perceptions of one man become the creed and superficial life-element of other minds. Swedenborg1 is worthy to be enrolled among the master minds of the world, because he entered for himself into the Arcana of the profoundest mysteries that can concern human intelligences; his greatest thoughts are revolved, quoted and represented in all 'New Church' publications, but very rarely digested and assimilated by those who claim to be his followers. Still more rare is it to find any receiver of 'the heavenly doctrines' determined to enter for himself into the very interiors of all that Swedenborg taught—to see, to the mighty reflections that Swedenborg was able to give of interior realities, but their originals as they stand constellated in the heavens!</p><p>But Divine Providence, leading forth the race, as a father the tottering steps of his children, causes the outward form, on which all men are prone to rely, to be forever changing and passing away before their eyes. The seeds of death are ever found luring in the fairest external appearances, till those externals become the mere correspondences and representatives of interior realities, and then, though enduring as the fadeless garments of the blest, they are ever-varying, as those robes of light change with each changing state. The Coming Age will recognize the profoundest truths in the internal thought of the Swedish sage, while his most tenacious adherents will be forced to admit that, in externals, he often erred, and was not unfrequently deceived. But the discovered error will not only wean them from a blind and bigoted reliance upon frail man, but confirm the sincere lovers of truth in loyalty to her standard. So also, the spiritualists are being taught a severe but salutary lesson, that if they will penetrate into the heavenly Arcana of the Inner Life, they must do so by purifying and elevating their own minds, and not by 'sitting in circles' or ransacking town and country to find the most 'reliable Mediums.' Still no step in human progress and development is in vain; even the falls of the child are essential to his discipline. The mistakes and errors of men are needful while in their present imperfect state. They are to the seekers of truth what trials and losses are to those in the pursuit of wealth; they but enhance the value of the prize, and confirm the devotion of the true aspirant as frowns rekindle the ardor of lovers.</p><p>Moreover, as man must ever enter into the kingdom of a new unfolding truth with the simplicity and teachableness of little children, it is well that the outer form of the old disappear, that the new may stand alone in its place. It seems also to be a Law that when a change entire and universal is to be outwrought, the means preparatory to its introduction shall be equally widespread, and ultimated to the lowest possible plane. Hence the Spiritual manifestations meet the most external minds; and allow even the unregenerate to know by experience the fact and process of Spiritual inspiration; so that scepticism becomes impossible to the candid and living mind. The second step will be, after such have been convinced that Spiritual intercourse is possible, that they learn that it is worse than useless for the purpose of attaining anything desirable, beyond this conviction—except so far as is orderly and directed, not by the will of man, but of God. But as the old form of poetic inspiration died out with Byron and Shelley, Wordsworth and Goethe, and the miscellaneous Spirit-intercourse itself also as quickly passes away, there will, we apprehend, spring up forms of mediatorial inspiration, of which there will be two permanent types. The first and highest, as it seems to us, will be the opening of the interiors to direct influx to the inspiring sources of love and wisdom. The heavens will flow down into the hearts and lives, into the thought and speech of harmonic natures, as the silent dews impregnate the patient earth. Men will live in heaven, hence they must be inspired by that breath of life that fills its ethereal expanse. A second class of Media will be used for the ultimation, for ends of use and in accordance with Laws of Order, of the creative thoughts and hymns, the Epics and Lyrics, of individual Spirits and societies of Spirits. These will be to the former Media as the youthful artist who copies the work of a master, to the Angelos and Raphaels, who both design and execute their plans, though they themselves, in their deepest interiors, are instructed and sustained from above.</p><p>But in the transition period in which we now are, many varieties of Mediumship must be expected. There are those who stand in rapport with the diseased mentalities of the past and present and pour forth as Divine Revelations the froth and scum of a receding age; they are the sponges who absorb the waste and impurities of humanity. They are also like running sores that gather the corrupt humors and drain the body of its most noxious fluids. There are others who come in contact with the outmost portion of the Spirit-life. These give crude, and in themselves, false notions of the state of man after death; yet they prepare the way for more truthful disclosures; if in no other way by stimulating the appetite for more substantial nourishment. There are those who are lifted by genial inspirations to receive influxes from the upper mind-sphere of the age. They stand, as it were, on clear mountains of intellectual elevation, and with keenest perception discern the purer forms of new unfolding truths ere they become sufficiently embodied to be manifest to the grosser minds of the race. Of these Ralph Waldo Emerson is the highest-type. He sees the future of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man; he welcomes those impalpable forms, as Spiritualists receive with gladdened minds the returning hosts of Spirit-friends.</p><p>There are other mediatorial natures who are in mental and heart-sympathy with man, as he now is, struggling to free himself from the tyranny of the old and effete, and to grasp and retain the new life flowing down from the heavens. And as the kindling rays at first produce more smoke than fire, so their lay is one of promise rather than performance. Such we conceive to be the interior condition of the author of Leaves of Grass. He accepts man as he is as to his whole nature, and all men as his own brothers. The lambent flame of his genius encircles the world—nor does he clearly discern between that which is to be preserved, and that which is but as fuel for the purification of the ore from its dross. There is a wild strength, a Spartan simplicity about the man, and he stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation, like a drunken Hercules amid the dainty dancers. That his song is highly mediatorial he himself asserts, though probably he is unacquainted with the Spiritual developments of the age.</p><p>Through me [he sings] many long dumb voices,<br>Voices of the interminable generations of slaves,<br>Voices of the diseased and despairing.<br>Voices of the cycles of preparation and accretion,<br>And of threads that connect the stars,<br>And of the rights of them the others are down upon.<br>Through me forbidden voices—voices veiled,<br>Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured.</p><p>We omit much even in this short extract, for the book abounds in passages that cannot be quoted in drawing-rooms, and expressions that fall upon the tympanums of ears polite, with a terrible dissonance. His very gait, as he walks through the world, makes dainty people nervous; and conservatives regard him a social revolution. His style is everywhere graphic and strong, and he sings many things before untouched in prose or rhyme in an idiom that is neither prose nor rhyme, nor yet orthodox blank verse. But it serves his purpose well. He wears strange garb, cut and made by himself, as gracefully as a South American cavalier his poncho. We will continue our quotations.</p><p>Such are the graphic pictures which this new world-painter flings from his easel and dashes upon the moving panorama of life. His night-thoughts are not less striking, as borne by the Muse, he looks into every chamber, and hears the quiet breathing of slumbering humanity.</p><p>As the volume advances towards its conclusion, the Spirit of the poet becomes calmer and more serenely elevated. But everywhere his sympathy is with man, and not with conventionalisms.</p><p>We cannot take leave of this remarkable volume without advising our friends who are not too delicately nerved, to study the work as a sign of the times, written as we perceive, under powerful influxes; a prophecy and promise of much that awaits all who are entering with us into the opening doors of a new era. A portion of that thought which broods over the American nation, is here seized and bodied forth by a son of the people, rudely, wildly, and with some perversions, yet strongly and genuinely, according to the perception of this bold writer. He is the young Hercules who has seized the serpents that would make him and us their prey; but instead of strangling, he would change them to winged and beautiful forms, who shall become the servants of mankind.</p>",

	"title": "Studies Among the Leaves",
	"body": "<p>THE ASSEMBLY OF EXTREMES.—A subtle old proverb says, 'extremes meet,' and science, Art, and even morality, sometimes testify to the truth of the proverb; and there are some curious problems involved in the demonstration of it. The loftiest attainment of the wisdom and worth of age only reaches to the simplicity and fervor of childhood, from which we all start, and returning to which we are blessed. Art makes the same voyage round its sphere, holding ever westward its way into new and unexplored regions, until it does what Columbus would have done, had his faith and self-denial been greater, reaches the east again. If the individual, Columbus, failed to accomplish the destiny, the class, Columbus, fails never. And so in Art, what no one does, the many accomplish, and finally the cycle is filled.</p><p>We see this most forcibly in the comparison of two late poems, as unlike, at first thought, as two could be, and yet in which the most striking likenesses prevail, 'MAUD,' and 'LEAVES OF GRASS;'† the one as refined in its Art as the most refined, delicate in its structure, and consummate in its subtlety of expression, the other rude and rough, and heedless in its forms—nonchalant in everything but its essential ideas. The one comes from the last stage of cultivation of the Old World, and shows evidence of morbid, luxurious waste of power, and contempt of mental wealth, from inability longer to appreciate the propriety of subjects on which to expend it; as, to one who has overlived, all values are the same, because nothing, and indifferent; while the other, from among the 'roughs,' is morbid from overgrowth, and likewise prodigal of its thought-treasure, because it has so much that it can afford to throw it away on everything, and considers all things that are, as equally worth gilding. The subject of MAUD is nothing—a mere common-place incident, but artistically dealt with—a blanched, decayed sea-shell, around which the amber has gathered; and that of the newer poem is equally nothing, blades of sea-grass amber-cemented. Both are characterized by the extreme of affectation of suggestiveness—piers of thought being given, over which the reader must throw his own arches. Both are bold, defiant of laws which attempt to regulate forms, and of those which should regulate essences. Maud is irreligious through mental disease, produced by excess of sentimental action—'Leaves of Grass', through irregularly-developed mental action and insufficiency of sentiment. A calmer perception of Nature would have corrected in Tennyson that feeling which looks upon sorrow as the only thing poetic, and serenity and holy trust, as things to which Love has no alliance, while a higher seeing of Nature would have shown Walt Whitman that all things in Nature are not alike beautiful, or to be loved and honored by song.</p><p>Although it is mainly with the Art of the two poems that we have to deal, the form rather than the motive, yet so entirely does the former arise from the latter that the criticism passed on the one must lie upon the other. In the mere versification,for instance, of both, see what indifference to the dignity of verse (while there is still the extorted homage to its forms), arising in both cases, it would seem, from an overweening confidence in the value of what is said, as in the following passages:</p><p>'Long have I sighed for a calm; God grant I may find it at last!It will never be broken by Maud, she has neither savor nor salt,But a cold, clear, cut face, as I found when her carriage past,Perfectly beautiful: let it be granted her: where is the fault?'</p><p>Maud, Sec. ii., St. 1.</p><p>'Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now.<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward<br>annihilation?<br>Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,<br>Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good.<br>The whole universe indicates that it is good.<br>The past and present indicates that it is good.'</p><p>Leaves of Grass, p. 69.</p><p>All Tennyson's exquisite care over his lines produces no other impression than that which Whitman's carelessness arrives at; viz., nonchalance with regard to forms. In either case, it is an imperfection, we are bold to say, since we do not love beauty and perfection of form for nothing, nor can the measure of poetic feeling be full when we do not care for the highest grace and symmetry of construction. It is an impertinence which says to us, 'my ideas are so fine that they need no dressing up,' even greater than that which says, 'mine are so fine that they cannot be dressed as well as they deserve.' The childlike instinct demands perfect melody as an essential to perfect poetry, and more than that, the melodious thought will work out its just and adequate form by the essential law of its spiritual organization—when the heart sings, the feet will move to its music. An unjust measure in verse is prima facie evidence of a jarring note in the soul of the poem, and studied or permitted irregularity of form proves an arrogant self-estimation or irreverence in the poet; and both these poems are irreverent, irreligious, in fact. Maud commences, singularly enough, with the words, 'I hate,' and the whole sentiment of the poem ignores the nobler and purer feelings of humanity—it is full of hatred and morbid feeling, diseased from pure worldliness. This is well enough for one whom the world calls a laureate, but the true poet seeks a laurel that the world cannot gather, growing on mountains where its feet never tread, he lives with beauty and things holy, or, if evil things come to him, it is that they may be commanded behind him. 'Maud' rambles and raves through human love and human hate, and the hero lives his life of selfish desire and selfish enjoyment, and then through the bitterness of selfish regret and despair, without one thought of anything better, nobler than himself—the summit of creation. He worships nothing, even reverences nothing, his love is only passion, and his only thought of God one of fear. In his happiness, he is a cynic, in his unhappiness, a madman.</p><p>For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the<br>veil.<br>Who knows the ways of the world, how God will bring<br>them about?<br>Our planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide.<br>Shall I weep if a Poland fail? shall I shriek if a Hun-<br>gary fail?<br>Or an infant civilization be ruled with rod or with<br>nout?<br>I have not made the world, and He that made it will<br>guide.<br>Be mine a philosopher's life in the quiet woodland<br>ways,<br>Where if I cannot be gay let a passionless peace be my<br>lot,<br>Far off from the clamor of liars belied in the hubbub<br>of lies;<br>From the long-neck'd geese of the world that are ever<br>hissing dispraise<br>Because their natures are little, and, whether he heed<br>it or not,<br>Where each man walks with his head in a cloud of<br>poisonous flies.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Dead, long dead,<br>Long dead!<br>And my heart is a handful of dust,<br>And the wheels go over my head,<br>And my bones are shaken with pain,<br>For into a shallow grave they are thrust,<br>Only a yard beneath the street,<br>And the hoofs of the horses beat, beat,<br>The hoofs of the horses beat,<br>Beat into my scalp and my brain,<br>With never an end to the stream of passing feet,<br>Driving, hurrying, marrying, burying,<br>Clamor and rumble, and ringing and clatter,<br>And here beneath it is all as bad,<br>For I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;<br>To have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?<br>But up and down and to and fro,<br>Ever about me the dead men go;<br>And then to hear a dead man chatter<br>Is enough to drive one mad.<br>Wretchedest age, since Time began,<br>They cannot even bury a man;<br>And tho' we paid our tithes in the days that are<br>gone,<br>Not a bell was rung, not a prayer was read;<br>It is that which makes us loud in the world of the<br>dead;<br>There is none that does his work, not one;<br>A touch of their office might have sufficed,<br>But the churchmen fain would kill their church,<br>As the churches have kill'd their Christ.<br>See, there is one of us sobbing,<br>No limit to his distress;<br>And another, a lord of all things, praying<br>To his own great self, as I guess;<br>And another, a statesman there, betraying<br>His party-secret, fool, to the press;<br>And yonder a vile physician, blabbing<br>The case of his patient—all for what?<br>To tickle the maggot born in an empty head,<br>And wheedle a world that loves him not,<br>For it is but a world of the dead.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' is irreligious, because it springs from a low recognition of the nature of Deity, not, perhaps, so in intent, but really so in its result. To Whitman, all things are alike good—no thing is better than another, and thence there is no ideal, no aspiration, no progress to things better. It is not enough that all things are good, all things are equally good, and, therefore, there is no order in creation; no better, no worse—but all is a democratic level from which can come no symmetry, in which there is no head, no subordination, no system, and, of course, no result. With a wonderful vigor of thought and intensity of perception, a power, indeed, not often found, 'Leaves of Grass' has no ideality, no concentration, no purpose—it is barbarous, undisciplined, like the poetry of a half-civilized people, and, as a whole, useless, save to those miners of thought who prefer the metal in its unworked state. The preface of the book contains an inestimable wealth of this unworked ore—it is a creed of the material, not denying the ideal, but ignorant of it.</p><p>'The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into anything that was before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe. He is a seer…he is individual…he is complete in himself…the others are as good as he, only he sees it and they do not. He is not one of the chorus…he does not stop for any regulation: he is the president of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest he does to the rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other senses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but its own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all the instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What is marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible, or baseless, or vague? after you have once just opened the space of a peachpit, and given audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things enter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion, or jostling, or jam.</p><p>'The land and sea, the animals, fishes, and birds, the sky of heaven and the orbs, the forests, mountains, and rivers, are not small themes…but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb, real objects…they expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the beauty well enough…probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of hunters, woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens, and orchards, and fields, the love of healthy women for the manly form, sea-faring persons, drivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence of the poetic in out-door people. They can never be assisted by poets to perceive…some may, but they never can. The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme, or uniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these and much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity, that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws, and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs or roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts, and oranges, and melons, and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems, or music, or orations, or recitations, are not independent, but dependent. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough…the fact will prevail through the universe…but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.</p><p>*****</p><p>'The greatest poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is.

But still they are the extremes—truth lies between them always. What if Columbus had sailed round the world, and made its extremes meet!

	"title": "Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)",
	"body": "<p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn. 1855.</p><p>EVERYTHING about the external arrangement of this book was odd and out of the way. The author printed it himself, and it seems to have been left to the winds of heaven to publish it. So it happened that we had not discovered it before our last number, although we believe the sheets had then passed the press. It bears no publisher's name, and, if the reader goes to a bookstore for it, he may expect to be told at first, as we were, that there is no such book, and has not been. Nevertheless, there is such a book, and it is well worth going twice to the bookstore to buy it. Walter Whitman, an American,—one of the roughs,—no sentimentalist,—no stander above men and women, or apart from them,—no more modest than immodest,—has tried to write down here, in a sort of prose poetry, a good deal of what he has seen, felt, and guessed at in a pilgrimage of some thirty-five years. He has a horror of conventional language of any kind. His theory of expression is, that, 'to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, is the flawless triumph of art.' Now a great many men have said this before. But generally it is the introduction to something more artistic than ever,—more conventional and strained. Antony began by saying he was no orator, but none the less did an oration follow. In this book, however, the prophecy is fairly fulfilled in the accomplishment. 'What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>So truly accomplished is this promise,—which anywhere else would be a flourish of trumpets,—that this thin quarto deserves its name. That is to say, one reads and enjoys the freshness, simplicity, and reality of what he reads, just as the tired man, lying on the hill-side in summer, enjoys the leaves of grass around him,—enjoys the shadow,—enjoys the flecks of sunshine,—not for what they 'suggest to him,' but for what they are.</p><p>So completely does the author's remarkable power rest in his simplicity, that the preface to the book—which does not even have large letters at the beginning of the lines, as the rest has—is perhaps the very best thing in it. We find more to the point in the following analysis of the 'genius of the United States,' than we have found in many more pretentious studies of it.</p><p>'Other states indicate themselves in their deputies, but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors;—but always most in the common people. Their manners, speech, dress, riendships;—the freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their deathless attachment to freedom, their aversion to everything indecorous or soft or mean, the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one State by the citizens of all other States, the fierceness of their roused resentment, their curiosity and welcome of novelty, their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy, their susceptibility to a slight, the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors, the fluency of their speech, their delight in music (the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul), their good temper and open-handedness, the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him,—these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.'</p><p>The book is divided into a dozen or more sections, and in each one of these some thread of connection may be traced, now with ease, now with difficulty,—each being a string of verses, which claim to be written without effort and with entire abandon. So the book is a collection of observations, speculations, memories, and prophecies, clad in the simplest, truest, and often the most nervous English,—in the midst of which the reader comes upon something as much out of place as a piece of rotten wood would be among leaves of grass in the meadow, if the meadow had no object but to furnish a child's couch. So slender is the connection, that we hardly injure the following scraps by extracting them.</p><p>'I am the teacher of Athletes;<br>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own, proves the width of<br>my own;<br>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher;<br>The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not through derived power, but<br>in his own right,<br> Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br>Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse than a wound cuts,<br>First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's-eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a<br>song, or to play on the banjo,<br>Preferring scars, and faces pitted with small-pox, over all latherers and<br>those that keep out of the sun.'<br>Here is the story of the gallant seaman who rescued the passengers<br>on the San Francisco:—<br>'I understand the large heart of heroes,<br>The courage of present times and all times;<br>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship,<br>and death chasing it up and down the storm,<br>How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of<br>days and faithful of nights,<br>And chalked in large letters on a board, 'Be of good cheer, we will not<br>desert you';<br>How he saved the drifting company at last,<br>How the lank, loose-gowned women looked when boated from the side of<br>their prepared graves,<br>How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipped,<br>unshaved men;<br>All this I swallowed, and it tastes good; I like it well, and it becomes<br>mine:<br>I am the man, I suffered, I was there.'</p><p>Claiming in this way a personal interest in every thing that has ever happened in the world, and, by the wonderful sharpness and distinctness of his imagination, making the claim effective and reasonable, Mr. 'Walt Whitman' leaves it a matter of doubt where he has been in this world, and where not. It is very clear, that with him, as with most other effective writers, a keen, absolute memory, which takes in and holds every detail of the past,—as they say the exaggerated power of the memory does when a man is drowning,—is a gift of his organization as remarkable as his vivid imagination. What he has seen once, he has seen for ever. And thus there are in this curious book little thumb-nail sketches of life in the prairie, life in California, life at school, life in the nursery,—life, indeed, we know not where not,—which, as they are unfolded one after another, strike us as real,—so real that we wonder how they came on paper.</p><p>For the purpose of showing that he is above every conventionalism, Mr. Whitman puts into the book one or two lines which he would not address to a woman nor to a company of men. There is not anything, perhaps, which modern usage would stamp as more indelicate than are some passages in Homer. There is not a word in it meant to attract readers by its grossness, as there is in half the literature of the last century, which holds its place unchallenged on the tables of our drawing-rooms. For all that, it is a pity that a book where everything else is natural should go out of the way to avoid the suspicion of being prudish.</p>",

	"title": "Review of Leaves of Grass (1855)",
	"body": "<p>LEAVES OF GRASS Brooklyn, N.Y. 1855.</p><p>Such is the curt and undescriptive title of a prose poem which has created some remark in certain literary circles. It is in every way a singular volume: singular in its form, singular in its arrangement, singular in its style, and most singular of all in its rhapsodical fancies. Its title-page, as will be seen, bears upon it the name of no author, and the book is ushered into the world without the patronage of any publisher to give it currency and protection. Of 'complimentary copies' for the press, none, so far as we are aware, have been vouchsafed by the writer. Ostrich-like, he has laid his egg in the sand and left it to quicken or not, according to that time and chance which, as the wise man says, happen to all things. We are not left, however, in the body of the work, wholly ignorant of the writer's name, profession, or age—'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest,' is the odd fish who avows himself as the father of this odd volume. Walt Whitman is a printer by trade, whose punctuation is as loose as his morality, and who no more minds his ems than his p's and q's. He tells us that he was born on the last day of May, and 'passed from a babe in the creeping trance of three summers and three winters to articulate and walk,' all which he thinks 'wonderful;' while that he 'grew six feet high and became a man thirty-six years old in 1855, and that he is [I am] here any how,' are facts which he pronounces equally 'wonderful' in the wonder-world of his philosophy.</p><p>Though Walt Whitman has modestly withheld his name from the title-page of his production, he has favored us with his likeness by way of frontispiece to the volume. If the artist has faithfully depicted his effigy, Walt is indeed 'one of the roughs;' for his picture would answer equally well for a 'Bowery boy,'1 one of the 'killers,' 'Mose' in the play, 'Bill Sykes after the murder of Nancy,'2 or the 'B'hoy that runs with the engine,' much as we have known certain 'portraits taken from life' compelled to do duty in pictorial newspapers as the true likeness of half a dozen celebrated criminals. Walt Whitman is evidently the 'representative-man' of the 'roughs.'</p><p>The avowed object of Walter in the loose quarto before us is to 'celebrate' himself; and as the pastoral muse of Virgil 'meditated' on a slender oat straw, so Mr. Whitman 'leans and loafes' at his ease, 'observing a spear of summer grass.' Holy Writ informs us that 'all flesh is grass,' which, according to quaint old Sir Thomas Browne, is just as true literally as metaphorically; for all the adipose matter deposited in the human body from roast beef and mutton is, after all, at the bottom of the account only grass taking upon itself a coat of flesh, for grass forms the ox and roast beef forms the physical man; ergo, the most carnivorous gastronome, no less than the most immaculate vegetarian, is nothing but grass at the last chemical analysis of his constituents. Hence it will be seen that 'grass' is what Mr. Whitman calls a 'uniform hieroglyphic' of the whole human family, and as such deserves to be scanned by the minute philosopher.</p><p>A handful of grass fetched by a child to Walter Whitman inspires him with mysterious thoughts which he vainly essays to grasp, and hints intrusive questionings which he vainly endeavors to answer. At first he guesses that blades of grass 'must be the flag of his disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven,' and anon he guesses they are the 'handkerchief of the Lord,' designedly dropped from above 'as scented gifts and remembrancers.' He next guesses that 'the grass itself is a child, the produced babe of the vegetation,' and now he exclaims, in the next breath, 'it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves,' and hence he feels like caressing it, and breaks out in the following address to the 'curling grass:'</p><p>'It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;<br>It may be that if I had known them I would have loved them;<br>It may be that you are from old people and from women, and from<br>offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps,<br>And here you are the mother's lap.</p><p>*****</p><p>What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br>And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br>They are alive and well somewhere.<br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death;<br>All goes onward and outward…and nothing collapses,<br>And to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier.<br>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?<br>I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die, and I<br>know it.'</p><p>The reader who has proceeded only thus far begins already to discover that Walter Whitman is a pantheist. Without, perhaps, ever having read Spinoza, he is a Spinozist. Without, perhaps, much deep insight into Plato the divine, he is a Platonist 'in the rough,' and believes profoundly in the 'immanence of all in each,' without ever once mouthing that grand phrase of the Greek philosopher. With-out knowing how to chop the formal logic of the schools, he is a necessitarian and fatalist, with whom 'whatever is is right.' The world as he finds it, and man as he is, good or bad, high or low, ignorant or learned, holy or vicious, are all alike good enough for Walter Whitman, who is in himself a 'kosmos,' and whose emotional nature is at once the sensorium of humanity and the sounding board which catches up and intones each note of joy or sorrow in the 'gamut of human feeling.'</p><p>He represents himself as being alike of the old and the young, of the foolish as much as the wise; maternal in his instincts as well as paternal; a child as well as a man; a Southerner as soon as a Northerner; a planter, nonchalant and hospitable; a Yankee, bound his own way and ever ready for a swap; a Kentuckian, walking the trail of the Elkhorn with deerskin leggings; a boatman over the lakes or bays or along coasts; a Hoosier, a Badger, a Wolverine, a Buckeye, a Louisianian, a 'poke-easy' from sandbills and pines: at home equally on the hills of Vermont, or in the woods of Maine, or the Texas ranch; a learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfulest, a farmer, mechanic, or artist, a gentleman, sailor, lover, or quaker, a prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, or priest. He rejoices to feel that he is 'not stuck up and is in his [my] place,' for</p><p>'The moth and the fish eggs are in their place:<br>The suns I see and the suns I cannot see are in their place;<br>The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.'</p><p>So fully has the world-spirit possessed the soul of Walter that he thinks he could turn and live awhile with the animals; 'they are so placid and self-contained' that he sometimes 'stands and looks at them half the day long.'</p><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition;They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins;They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's philosophy, it will be seen, is somewhat different from Blaise Pascal's, and we hope we shall not hurt Mr. W's feelings if we venture to give to the devout Jansenist a slight precedence over him. Pascal, the poor man, having no better guides than his own august reason and the oracles of divine inspiration, in his profound speculations on the greatness and misery of man, came to the conclusion that man's consciousness of his misery was one of the most signal and primary proofs of his greatness. These anxious longings of the soul as for an unknown good were to his mind the indication of slumbering capacities not yet developed, and revealed that power of introspection and self-scrutiny which is at once the attribute of consciousness and the attestation of human responsibility. The man who degrades himself to the level of the brutes, or sinks even lower than they, does yet by his very nature rise above them in that he is conscious of his degradation. At least so thought Pascal, and so think still all those who find in man's consciousness the proof of his dignity and of his elevation above the brute creation.</p><p>Mr. Whitman thinks, however, he would like to turn and live awhile with the animals. Well, one's associates should certainly be determined according to one's tastes. Every one to his liking, as remarked the venerable dame in the proverb when she kissed her cow. De gustibus, &c. Mr. Whitman, it is true, can plead royal example and ancient precedent in defence of his 'passional attraction' towards the dumb animals. King Nebuchadnezzar, many years before him, consorted with the oxen of the field and went to graze after the most approved style of the bovine quadruped. We do not read, however, that his majesty greatly relished this species of out door life, and all, we doubt doubt [sic] because, 'unlike one of the roughs,' he failed to remark how 'placid and self-contained' were his companions of the herd. Nebuchadnezzar too, it is to be feared, lacked the proper pantheistic instincts to permit his entering fully into the sublime mysteries of Serapis3 and Anubis.4 If his life-experiences had been the same as 'Walt Whitman's' before undergoing his change, he might have managed better to enjoy his new society.</p><p>In the 'Golden Ass' of Apuleius we have also another record of life among the animals. We need not repeat the story of Fotis's ill-starred lover and his magical transformation into an ass, with the long series of misfortunes, the cudgellings and flayings which, sad to tell, befell him in that condition. Are they not all written in the 'golden' book aforesaid?—a book which Mr. Whitman, we are sure, would find very much after his own heart in its freedom from anything like sentimental refinement or prudish delicacy, while it is to be hoped that its faithful portraiture of life among the graminivors [grass eaters] would cure him of his disposition to herd awhile with the quadrupeds, and render him willing to content himself with his present advantages in the privilege of 'standing and looking at them half the day long.' It behooves him also to bear in mind that according to all accounts the condition of the Irish peasantry is not greatly elevated over 'the rest of mankind' by their hereditary custom of assigning to the 'placid' porker and domestic cow a cozy corner in the cabin along with its other inmates. If much good was to be expected from turning and living with the animals, Ireland would have convinced the world of it long before Mr. Whitman's day, and if he had properly studied her history we question whether he would have considered it a matter worth boasting of that he feels himself—</p><p>'Stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over.'</p><p>As we do not wish, however, to press Mr. Whitman too hard upon this point, and seek to exhibit rather the philosophy of his teachings than his petits ridicules, we append in this same connection the following lyrical outburst of the true pantheistic spirit:</p><p>How beautiful and perfect are the animals! How perfect is my soul!<br>How perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it!<br>What is called good is perfect, and what is called sin is just as<br>perfect.<br>The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and imponderable<br>fluids are perfect.<br>Oh, my soul! If I realize you I have satisfaction. Laws of the earth<br>and air! If I realize you I have satisfaction.<br>I swear I see now that every thing has a living soul!<br>The trees have, rooted in the ground; the weeds of the sea have;<br>the animals!</p><p>It is quite possible that, owing to some radical and congenital defect of our mental organization, we have never been able to penetrate 'within the veil' in the Pantheon of the transcendentalists and of the Emersonian school in general. Mr. Emerson, we understand, greatly admires the present work; indeed, we have read a published letter of his in which he tenders to Mr. Whitman his thanks for the Leaves of Grass. When we read that eulogy we were satisfied that this volume would prove to us a sealed book, and that its hieroglyphs would be as unintelligible to our ken as was the inscription around the sacred ibex to the erudite Mr. George Robins Gliddon.5 Still we determined to read it, in the humble but earnest hope of endeavoring occasionally to catch its esoteric meaning in a few at least of those passages, which we are assured from Mr. Emerson's enjoyment of them must contain a hidden significance which nothing less potent than the magic salve of the dervise of Balsora can open our eyes to behold; and in default of which we must be content with such a poor comprehension of these Sibylline leaves as falls to the lot of common readers.</p><p>No one, we may say, however, in all candor, can read this singular prose-poem without being struck by the writer's wonderful powers of description and of word-painting. His memory seems as retentive of its treasures as his imagination is opulent in its creations. He writes like one who has but to prick his mind and forthwith it gushes out in a perennial flow of 'thoughts which have tarried in its inner chambers.' It is only when we are balked in our attempt to trail his transcendental sinuosities of thought that we feel ourselves at fault, and then we are reminded of Longfellow's description of the Emersonian philosophy, which he likened to some of the roads in our great West, which at first open very fair and wide, and are shaded on both sides by the towering giants of the primeval forest, but which before long become narrower and narrower and at last dwindle to a squirrel path and run up a tree.</p>",

	"title": "Our Book Table",
	"body": "<p>LEAVES OF GRASS. Entered according to Act of Congress, by Walter Whitman, &c., &c., Brooklyn.</p><p>A new edition, we believe, of the famous Whitman's poems, which made such a flutter among the 'gray goose quills' of this city and 'other quarters of the globe' some time ago. Of the poem which occupies the ninety-five pages of this folio, we have before briefly spoken. Upon examining it a second time, and pondering its aims and expressions, we feel constrained to say that it is certainly the strangest, most extraordinary production we have ever attempted to peruse. Still, like the rest of our countrymen, we are by no means either averse to extraordinary things or afraid of them. We enjoy enterprise in speech and writing as thoroughly as in steam vessels, revolving rifles or new-found Nicaraguas. Therefore we shall not quarrel with Mr. Whitman for being odd. Oddness is the normal condition of some natures—of the freshest and best, perhaps—at least when it means frankness and opposition to solemn propriety, alias humbug and red tape.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's preface is what the hum-drum world calls 'queer' as entirely perhaps as his poem, yet we think a great deal of it both finely and bravely uttered as well as true. None can, more than we do, entirely hate that cant which always ascribes this or that kind of writing to this or the other 'school,' as if the young author had necessarily in every instance copied some model; as if two similarly constituted minds may not naturally seek similar expression! It is precisely this stupid, stereotyped classification adopted by indolent or clique-led reviewers, that has produced so many abortions in literature through the straining after at least the appearance of total originality, but to give future readers of this book some indication of its style, ere they have opened it, we will say that it is Germanic and Carlylean—even Emersonian—sometimes in the strain of Martin Farquhar Tupper,1 although far stronger and more pointed than the latter.</p><p>The poem exhibits undoubted and striking evidence of genius and power. But the author reasoning that the spirit of the American people, nay, of any people is chiefly represented by its uncultivated though, perhaps, naturally intelligent classes, falls into the error of mistaking their frequent uncouthness as a fair revelation of that spirit, and the bathos often produced in some of his finest passages by the presence of this idea defaces his work and repels hundreds of candid minds who would be eager to acknowledge his claims, but are thus prevented from reading enough to recognize them.</p><p>In glancing rapidly over the 'Leaves of Grass' you are puzzled whether to set the author down as a madman or an opium eater; when you have studied them you recognize a poet of extraordinary vigor, nay even beauty of thought, beneath the most fantastic possible garments of diction. If Hamlet had gone mad, in Ophelia's way, as well as in his own, and in addition to his own vein of madness, he might, when transported to our own age and country, have talked thus.</p><p>In a crush hat and red shirt open at the neck, without waistcoat or jacket, one hand on his hip and the other thrust into his pocket, Walt Whitman the b'hoy poet, on his muscle, writes sentences like these:</p><p>'A child said, What is grass?—fetching it to me with<br>full hands.<br>How could I answer the child…I do not know what it<br>is any more than he.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of<br>graves.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of<br>old mothers.<br>Darker than the colorless bears of old men,<br>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.<br>Oh I perceive, after all, so many uttering tongues!<br>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths<br>for nothing.[']</p><p>Again:</p><p>[']Press close, bare bosomed night! Press close<br>magnetic nourishing night!<br>Night of South winds! Night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night! Mad naked Summer night!</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!<br>Sea of the brine of life! Sea of unshovelled and always ready<br>graves!'</p><p>His own picture:</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshy, sensual…eating, drinking and breeding,<br>No sentimentalist…no stander above men and women or<br>apart from the,…no more modest than immodest.'</p><p>Yet, he is a sentimentalist! Read the lines beginning</p><p>'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey<br>work of the stars, etc.—'</p><p>He is a painter, carver and sculptor:</p><p>'A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my<br>caresses,<br>Head high in the forehead and between the ears,<br>Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,<br>Eyes well apart and full of sparkling wickedness…ears<br>finely cut and flexibly moving.'</p><p>He is a genuine 'rough'—a male muse in horse-blanket and boots. Sometimes he is 'Mose;' sometimes almost a Moses.</p><p>He enjoys 'he-festivals with blackguard jibes, and ironical license, and bull dances, and drinking, and laughter.' Then he is</p><p>'Pleased with primitive tunes of the choir of the white-<br>washed church,'</p><p>And then you see him</p><p>'Walking the old hills of Judea with the beautiful gentle<br>god by his side.'</p><p>Now, with him, we</p><p>'Visit the orchards of God, and look at quintillions green.'</p><p>Or</p><p>'Go hunting polar furs and the seal…leaping chasms<br>with a pike-pointed staff…clinging to topples<br>of brittle and blue.[']</p><p>Read this noble passage:</p><p>'How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of<br>steamship, and death chasing it up and down the storm,<br>How he knuckled tight and gave not back one inch, and was<br>faithful of days and faithful of nights,<br>And chalked in large letters on a board; Be of good cheer,<br>We will not desert you;<br>How he saved the drifting company at last,<br> How the lank loose-gowned women looked when boated from<br>the side of their prepared graves.<br>How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the<br>sharp-lipped unshaven men;[.]'</p><p>We are tempted to quote many strophes from this remarkable collection of genius inebriated with its own overflowing fountains of fancy, but must conclude with the following fine lines, referring to past struggles for freedom, and predicting a future:</p><p>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves…bloody corpses<br>of young men:<br>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily…the bullets of princes<br>are flying…the creatures of power laugh aloud,<br>And all these things bear fruits…and they are good.<br>Those corpses of young men,<br>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets…those hearts pierced<br>by the gray lead,<br>Cold and motionless as they seem…live elsewhere with<br> unslaughter'd vitality.<br>They live in other young men, O kings,<br>They live in brothers, again ready to defy you:<br>They were purified by death…They were taught and exalted.<br>Not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for<br>freedom…in its turn to bear seed,<br>Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the<br>snows nourish.<br>Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,<br>But it stalks invisibly over the earth…whispering counseling<br>cautioning.<br>Liberty let others despair of you…I never despair of you.<br>Is the house shut? Is the master away?<br>Nevertheless be ready…be not weary of watching,<br>He will soon return…his messengers come anon.</p><p>For the sum of 75 cents any reader may accompany Whitman through a poetic chaos—bright, dark, splendid, common, ridiculous and sublime—in which are floating the nebulae and germs of matter for a starry universe of organized and harmonious systems that may yet revolve, in all the magnificence of artistic order, through the highest heaven of fame!</p><p>As proof that whatever may be the merits or demerits of this singular production, we may state that very many thousand copies have been sold and the demand is still increasing.</p>",

	"body": "<p>We have before us one of the most extraordinary specimens of Yankee intelligence and American eccentricity in authorship, it is possible to conceive. It is of a genus so peculiar as to embarrass us, and has an air at once so novel, so audacious, and so strange as to verge upon absurdity, and yet it would be an injustice to pronounce it so, as the work is saved from this extreme by a certain mastery over diction not very easy of definition. What Emerson has pronounced to be good must not be lightly treated, and before we pronounce upon the merits of this performance it is but right to examine them. We have, then, a series of pithy prose sentences strung together—forming twelve grand divisions in all, but which, having a rude rhythmical cadence about them admit of the designation poetical being applied. They are destitute of rhyme, measure of feet, and the like, every condition under which poetry is generally understood to exist being absent; but in their strength of expression, their fervor, hearty wholesomeness, their originality, mannerism, and freshness, one finds in them a singular harmony and flow, as if by reading, they gradually formed themselves into melody, and adopted characteristics peculiar and appropriate to themselves alone. If, however, some sentences be fine, there are others altogether laughable; nevertheless, in the bare strength, the unhesitating frankness of a man who 'believes in the flesh and the appetites,' and who dares to call simplest things by their plainest names, conveying also a large sense of the beautiful, and with an emphasis which gives a clearer conception of what manly modesty really is than any thing we have, in all conventional forms of word, deed, or act so far known of, that we rid ourselves, little by little, of the strangeness with which we greet this bluff new-comer, and, beginning to understand him better, appreciate him in proportion as he becomes more known. He will soon make his way into the confidence of his readers, and his poems in time will become a pregnant text-book, out of which quotation as sterling as the minted gold will be taken and applied to every form and phase of the 'inner' or the 'outer' life; and we express our pleasure in making the acquaintance of Walt Whitman, hoping to know more of him in time to come.</p>",

	"body": "<p>We have received a volume, bound in green, and bearing the above title, under rather singular circumstances. Not only does the donor send us the book, but he favours us with hints—pretty broad hints—towards a favourable review of it. He has pasted in the first page a number of notices extracted with the scissors from American newspapers, and all magnificently eulogistic of Leaves of Grass. So original a proceeding merits an exceptional course; and therefore we shall confine ourselves to laying before our readers, first, the opinions of the American reviewers, and next giving specimens of the work reviewed. The relation of the two classes of extracts is curiously illustrative of contemporary American criticism.</p><p>The first panegyrist is not a newspaper writer, but the 'Representative Man,' Ralph Waldo Emerson:—</p><p>DEAR SIR,—I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of Leaves of Grass. I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the temperament, were making our Western wits fat and mean.</p><p>I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p><p>R. W. EMERSON.</p><p>From the Brooklyn Daily Times we take a description of Mr. Walt Whitman, the author of Leaves of Grass:—</p><p>He never offers others; what he continually offers is the man whom our Brooklynites know so well. Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from taint from top to toe, free for ever from headache and dyspepsia, full-blooded, six feet high, a good feeder, never once using medicine, drinking water only—a swimmer in the river or bay or by the seashore—of straight attitude and slow movement on foot—an indescribable style evincing indifference and disdain—ample limbed, weight a hundred and eighty-five pounds, age thirty-six years [1855]—never dressed in black, always dressed freely and clean in strong clothes, neck open, shirt collar flat and broad, countenance of swarthy transparent red, beard short and well mottled with white, hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked—face not refined or intellectual, but calm and wholesome—a face of an unaffected animal—a face that absorbs the sunshine and meets savage or gentleman on equal terms.</p><p>The American Phrenological Journal contrasts the poet of Leaves of Grass with Tennyson:—</p><p>The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy, and their combination into love. This love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare the same as the rest. It is possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connexion with the charms of the neck, hair, or complexion of a particular female…</p><p>Not a borrower from other lands, but a prodigal user of his own land is Walt Whitman. Not the refined life of the drawing-room—not dancing, and polish, and gentility, but some powerful uneducated person, and some harsh identity of sound, and all wild free forms, are grateful to him. A thrill of his own likeness strikes him as the spotted hawk wheels noisily near his head at nightfall, and he is fain to say,—</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>The United States Review discovers in Mr. Whitman the founder of an indigenous school of American poetry:—</p><p>Self-reliant, with haughty eyes, assuming to himself all the attributes of his country, steps Walt Whitman into literature, talking like a man unaware that there was ever hitherto such a production as a book, or such a being as a writer. Every move of him has the free play of the muscle of one who never knew what it was to feel that he stood in the presence of a superior. Every word that falls from his mouth shows silent disdain and defiance of the old theories and forms. Every phrase announces new laws; not once do his lips unclose except in conformity with them. With light and rapid touch he first indicates in prose the principles of the foundation of a race of poets so deeply to spring from the American people, and become ingrained through them, that their Presidents shall not be the common referees so much as that great race of poets shall. He proceeds himself to exemplify this new school, and set models for their expression and range of subjects. He makes audacious and native use of his own body and soul. He must recreate poetry with the elements always at hand. He must inbue it with himself as he is, disorderly, fleshy, and sensual, a lover of things, yet a lover of men and women above the whole of the other objects of the universe. His work is to be achieved by unusual methods. Neither classic nor romantic is he, nor a materialist any more than a spiritualist. Not a whisper comes out of him of the old stock talk and rhyme of poetry—not the first recognition of gods or goddesses, or Greece or Rome. No breath of Europe, or her monarchies or priestly conventions, or her notions of gentlemen and ladies founded on the idea of caste, seems ever to have fanned his face or been inhaled into his lungs. But in their stead pour vast and fluid the fresh mentality of this mighty age, and the realities of this mighty continent, and the sciences, and inventions, and discoveries of the present world. Not geology, nor mathematics, nor chemistry, nor navigation, nor astronomy, nor anatomy, nor phrenology, nor engineering, is more true to itself than Walt Whitman is true to them. They and the other sciences underlie his whole superstructure. In the beauty of the work of the poet, he affirms, are the tuft and final applause of science.</p><p>Now for the pièces justifcatives. The exordium of Leaves of Grass is as follows:—</p><p>I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>I loafe and invite my soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease…observing a spear of summer grass.<br>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes…the shelves are<br>crowded with perfumes,<br>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and like it,<br>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.<br>The atmosphere is not a perfume . . . . it has no taste of<br>the distillation…<br>It is odorless,<br>It is for my mouth forever…I am in love with it,<br>I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised<br>and naked,<br>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.</p><p>A little further on, the poet describes the subject of his poem, viz., himself:—</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly fleshy and sensual…eating drinking and breeding,<br>No sentimentalist…no stander above men and woman or apart<br>from them…no more modest than immodest.<br>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!<br>Whoever degrades another degrades me…and whatever is<br>done or said returns at last to me,<br>And whatever I do or say I also return.</p><p>The title of the poem is explained at page 16:—</p><p>A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with<br>full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?…I do not know what it<br>is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of<br>hopeeful green stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we<br>may see and remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child…the produced babe<br>of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I<br>receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>Mr. Whitman speculates on Humanity:—</p><p>What is a man anyhow? What am I? and what are you?<br>All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but thread-<br>bare crape and tears.<br>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids…conformity<br>goes to the fourth-removed,<br>I cock my hat as I please indoors or out.<br>hall I pray? Shall I venerate and be ceremonious?<br>I have pried through the strata and analysed to a hair,<br>And counselled with doctors and calculated close and found no sweeter fat<br>than sticks to my own bones.</p><p>Shortly afterwards the poet applies his theory of humanity to himself:—</p><p>I know I am august,<br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologize<br>I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all.<br>I exist as I am, that is enough,<br>If no other in the world be aware I sit content.<br>And if each and all be aware I sit content.</p><p>Our last extract embodies Mr. Whitman's theological creed:—</p><p>And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God,<br>For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,<br>No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about<br>death.<br>I hear and behold God in every object, yet I understand<br>God not in the least,<br>Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than<br>myself.<br>Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment<br>then,<br>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass;<br>I find letters from God dropped in the street, and every one is signed by<br>God's name,<br>And I leave them where they are, for I know that others will punctually<br>come for ever and ever.</p><p>After poetry like this, and criticism like this, it seems strange that we cannot recommend the book to our readers' perusal. But the truth is, that after every five or six pages of matter such as we have quoted, Mr. Whitman suddenly becomes exceedingly intelligible, but exceedingly obscene. If the Leaves of Grass should come into anybody's possession, our advice is to throw them instantly behind the fire.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, New York.</p><p>We have too long overlooked in this country the great poet who has recently arisen in America, of whom some of his countrymen speak in connection with Bacon and Shakespeare, whom others compare with Tennyson,—much to the disadvantage of our excellent laureate,—and to whom Mr Emerson writes that he finds in his book 'incomparable things, said incomparably well.' The book he pronounces 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed;' at which, indeed, says Mr Emerson in the printed letter sent to us,—'I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion.'</p><p>No illusion truly is Walt Whitman, the new American prodigy, who, as he is himself candid enough to intimate, sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. He is described by one of his own local papers as 'a tenderly affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral, susceptible, and imperious person,' who aspires to cast some of his own grit, whatever that may be, into literature. We have ourselves been disposed to think there is in literature grit enough, according to the ordinary sense, but decidedly Walt Whitman tosses in some more. The author describes himself as 'one of the roughs, a kosmos;' indeed, he seems to be very much impressed with the fact that he is a kosmos, and repeats it frequently. A kosmos we may define, from the portrait of it on the front of the book, as a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves, with one hand in a pocket of his pantaloons, and his wide-awake cocked with a dammee-sir air over his forehead.</p><p>On the other hand, according to an American review that flatters Mr Whitman, this kosmos is 'a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy.'</p><p>But as such terms of compliment may not be quite clear to English readers, we must be content, in simpler fashion, to describe to them this Brooklyn boy as a wild Tupper1 of the West. We can describe him perfectly by a few suppositions. Suppose that Mr Tupper had been brought up to the business of an auctioneer, then banished to the backwoods, compelled to live for a long time as a backwoodsman, and thus contracting a passion for the reading of Emerson and Carlyle? Suppose him maddened by this course of reading, and fancying himself not only an Emerson but a Carlyle and an American Shakespeare to boot when the fits come on, and putting forth his notion of that combination in his own self-satisfied way, and in his own wonderful cadences? In that state he would write a book exactly like Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass.</p><p>Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,<br>Say old topknot; what do you want?<br>Man or woman! I might tell how I like you, but cannot,<br>And might tell what it is in me, and what it is in you, but cannot,<br>And might tell the pinings I have . . . . the pulse of my nights and days.<br>Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity,<br>What I give I give out of myself.<br>You there, impotent, loose in the knees, open your scarfed chops till I blow grit<br>within you,<br>Spread your palms, and lift the flaps of your pockets,<br>I am not to be denied . . . . I compel . . . . I have stores plenty and to spare,<br>And any thing I have I bestow.</p><p>And again:—</p><p>Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?<br>Well, I have . . . . for the April rain has, and the mica on the side of a rock has.<br>Do you take it I would astonish?<br>Does the daylight astonish? or the early redstart, twittering through the woods?<br>Do I astonish more than they?<br>This hour I tell things in confidence,<br>I might not tell everybody but I will tell you.<br>Who goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude?<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?<br>What is a man anyhow? What am I? and what are you?<br>All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare crape<br>and tears.</p><p>But who am I?</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos,<br>Disorderly fleshy and sensual . . . . eating drinking and breeding,<br>No sentimentalist . . . . no stander above men and women or apart from them<br>. . . . no more modest than immodest.<br>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!<br>Whoever degrades another degrades me . . . . and whatever is done or said re-<br>turns at last to me,<br>And whatever I do or say I also return.<br>Through me the afflatus surging and surging . . . . through me the current and<br>index.</p><p>Could the metamorphosed Mr Tupper produce anything finer in his way than this:</p><p>I dote on myself . . . . there is that lot of me, and all so luscious,<br>Each moment, and whatever happens, thrills me with joy.<br>I cannot tell how my ankles bend . . . . nor whence the cause of my faintest<br>wish,<br>Nor the cause of the friendship I emit . . . . nor the cause of the friendship I<br>take again.<br>To walk up my stoop is unaccountable . . . . I pause to consider if it really be.<br>That I eat and drink is spectacle enough for the great authors and schools,<br>A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.<br>To behold the daybreak!<br>The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,<br>The air tastes good to my palate.<br>Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols, silently rising, freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.<br>Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,<br>Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.<br>The earth by the sky staid with . . . . the daily close of their junction,<br>The heaved challenge from the east that moment over my head,<br>The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!<br>Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me,<br>If I could not now and always send sunrise out of me.<br>We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,<br>We found our own my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.<br>My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,<br>With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.<br>Speech is the twin of my vision . . . . it is unequal to measure itself.<br>It provokes me forever,<br>It says sarcastically, Walt, you understand enough . . . . why don't you let it out<br>then?<br>Come now I will not be tantalized . . . . you conceive too much of articulation.</p><p>There is a speciality of personal reference in the succeeding passage new we think to literature:</p><p>Is it wonderful that I should be immortal! as every one is immortal,<br>I know it is wonderful . . . . but my eyesight is equally wonderful . . . . and<br>how I was conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful,<br>And how I was not palpable once, but am now . . . . and was born on the last day<br>of May 1819 . . . . and passed from a babe in the creeping trance of three<br>summers and three winters to articulate and walk . . . . are all equally<br>wonderful.<br>And that I grew six feet high . . . . and that I have become a man thirty-six<br>years old in 1855 . . . . and that I am here anyhow—are all equally won-<br>derful;<br>And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever<br>seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is every bit as<br>wonderful;<br>And that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful.</p><p>We must be just to Mr Whitman in allowing that he has one positive merit. His verse has a purpose. He desires to assert the pleasure that a man has in himself, his body and its sympathies, his mind (in a lesser degree, however) and its sympathies. He asserts man's right to express his delight in animal enjoyment, and the harmony in which he should stand, body and soul, with fellow men and the whole universe. To express this, and to declare that the poet is the highest manifestation of this, generally also to suppress shams, is the purport of these Leaves of Grass. Perhaps it might have been done as well, however, without being always so purposely obscene, and intentionally foul-mouthed, as Mr Whitman is.</p><p>I think I could turn and live awhile with the animals . . . . they are so placid<br>and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them sometimes half the day long.<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br>No one is dissatisfied . . . . not one is demented with the mania of owning<br>things,<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br>Not one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.<br>So they show their relations to me and I accept them;<br>They bring me tokens of myself . . . . they evince them plainly in their posses-<br>sion.</p><p>The fit being very strong indeed upon him, our Wild Tupper of the West thus puts into words his pleasure at the hearing of an overture:</p><p>The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,<br>It wrenches unnamable ardors from my breast,<br>It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror,<br>It sails me . . . . I dab with bare feet . . . . they are licked by the indolent<br>waves,<br>I am exposed . . . . cut by bitter and poisoned hail,<br>Steeped amid honeyed morphine . . . . my windpipe squeezed in the fakes of<br>death,<br>Let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,<br>And that we call Being.<br>To be in any form, what is that?<br>If nothing lay more developed the quahaug and its callous shell were enough.<br>Mine is no callous shell,<br>I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,<br>They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.<br>I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,<br>To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I can stand.</p><p>In the construction of our artificial Whitman, we began with the requirement that a certain philosopher should have been bred to the business of an auctioneer. We must add now, to complete the imitation of Walt Whitman, that the wild philosopher and poet, as conceived by us, should be perpetually haunted by the delusion that he has a catalogue to make. Three-fourths of Walt Whitman's book is poetry as catalogues of auctioneers are poems. Whenever any general term is used, off the mind wanders on this fatal track, and an attempt is made to specify all lots included under it. Does Mr Whitman speak of a town, he is at once ready with pages of town lots. Does he mention the American country, he feels bound thereupon to draw up a list of barns, waggons, wilds, mountains, animals, trees, people, 'a Hoosier, a Badger, a Backeye, a Lousianian, or Georgian, a poke-easy from sandhills and pines,' etc., etc. We will give an illustration of this form of lunacy. The subject from which the patient starts off is equivalent to things in general, and we can spare room only for half the catalogue. It will be enough, however, to show how there arises catalogue within catalogue, and how sorely the paroxysm is aggravated by the incidental mention of any one particular that is itself again capable of subdivision into lots.</p><p>The usual routine . . . . the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk;<br>The jaunt of hunting or fishing, or the life of hunting or fishing,<br>Pasturelife, foddering, milking and herding, and all the personnel and usages;<br>The plum-orchard and apple-orchard . . . . gardening . . seedlings, cuttings,<br>flowers and vines,<br>Grains and manures . . marl, clay, loam . . the subsoil plough . . the shovel and<br>pick and rake and hoe . . irrigation and draining;<br>The currycomb . . the horse-cloth . . the halter and bridle and bits . . the very<br>wisps of straw,<br>The barn and barn-yard . . the bins and mangers . . the mows and racks:<br>Manufactures . . commerce . . engineering . . the building of cities, and every<br>trade carried on there . . and the implements of every trade,<br>The anvil and tongs and hammer . . the axe and wedge . . the square and mitre<br>and jointer and smoothingplane;<br>The plumbob and trowel and level . . the wall-scaffold, and the work of walls and<br>ceilings . . or any mason-work:<br>The ship's compass . . the sailor's tarpaulin . . the stays and lanyards, and the<br>ground-tackle for anchoring or mooring,<br>The sloop's tiller . . the pilot's wheel and bell . . the yacht or fish-smack . .<br>the great gay-pennanted three-hundred-foot steamboat under full head-<br>way, with her proud fat breasts and her delicate swift-flashing paddles;<br>The trail and line and hooks and sinkers . . the seine, and hauling the seine;<br>Smallarms and rifles . . . . the powder and shot and caps and wadding . . . . the<br>ordnance for war . . . . the carriages:<br>Everyday objects . . . . the housechairs, the carpet, the bed and the counterpane<br>of the bed, and him or her sleeping at night, and the wind blowing, and<br>the indefinite noises:<br>The snowstorm or rainstorm . . . . the tow-trowsers . . . . the lodge-hut in the<br>woods, and the still-hunt:<br>City and country . . fireplace and candle . . gaslight and heater and aqueduct;<br>The message of the governor, mayor, or chief of police . . . . the dishes of break-<br>fast or dinner or supper;<br>The bunkroom, the fire-engine, the string-team, and the car or truck behind;<br>The paper I write on or you write on . . and every word we write . . and every<br>cross and twirl of the pen . . and the curious way we write what we<br>think . . . . yet very faintly;<br>The directory, the detector, the ledger . . . . the books in ranks or the book-<br>shelves. . . . the clock attached to the wall,<br>The ring on your finger . . the lady's wristlet . . the hammers of stonebreakers or<br>coppersmiths . . the druggist's vials and jars;<br>The etui of surgical instruments, and the etui of oculist's or aurist's instruments,<br>or dentist's instruments;<br>Glassblowing, grinding of wheat and corn . . casting, and what is cast . . tin-<br>roofing, shingledressing,<br>Shipcarpentering, flagging of sidewalks by flaggers . . dockbuilding, fishcuring,<br>ferrying;<br>The pump, the piledriver, the great derrick . . the coalkiln and brickkiln,<br>Ironworks or whiteleadworks . . the sugarhouse . . steam-saws, and the great<br>mills and factories;<br>The cottonbale . . the stevedore's hook . . the saw and buck of the sawyer . .<br>the screen of the coalscreener . . the mould of the moulder . . the work-<br>ingknife of the butcher;<br>The cylinder press . . the handpress . . the frisket and tympan . . the composi-<br>tor's stick and rule,<br>The implements for daguerreotyping . . . . the tools of the rigger or grappler or<br>sailmaker or blockmaker,<br>Goods of guttapercha or papiermache . . . . colors and brushes . . . . glaziers'<br>implements.</p><p>Now let us compare with this a real auctioneer's catalogue. We will take that of Goldsmith's2 chambers, by way of departing as little as we can from the poetical. For, as Mr Whitman would say (and here we quote quite literally, prefixing only a verse of our own, from 'A Catalogue of the Household Furniture with the select collection of scarce, curious, and valuable books of Dr Goldsmith, deceased, which, by order of the admr, will be sold by auction, &c., &c.)—</p><p>Surely the house of a poet is a poem, and behold a poet in the auctioneer who tells<br>you the whole lot of it,—<br>The bath stone, compass front, open border, fender, shovel, tongs, and poker,<br>The blue moreen festoon window-curtain . . . the mahogany dining-table on the<br>floor,<br>The six ditto hollow seat chairs covered with blue moreen,<br>Covered with blue moreen and finished with a double row of brass nails and check<br>cases,<br>The Wilton carpet . . . sun shade, line and pulleys . . . the deal sideboard<br>stained,<br>* * * *<br>The teapot, five coffee cups, sugar basin and cover . . . four saucers and six cups,<br>Two quart decanters and stoppers . . . one plain ditto . . . eleven glasses, one<br>wine and water glass,<br>A pair of bellows and a brush . . . a footman, copper tea-kettle and coalscuttle.<br>Two pairs of plated candlesticks.<br> A mahogany teaboard, a pet bordered ditto . . . a large round japanned ditto and<br>two waiters.<br>The Tragic Muse in a gold frame.</p><p>After all, we are not sure whether the poetry of that excellent Mr Good, the auctioneer who, at his Great Room, No. 121 Fleet street, sold the household furniture of Oliver Goldsmith in the summer of 1774, does not transcend in wisdom and in wit 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that' (according to Mr Emerson) 'America has yet contributed.'</p>",

	"body": "<p>Leaves of Grass New York. 1855. London. Horsell.</p><p>WE had ceased, we imagined, to be surprised at anything that America could produce. We had become stoically indifferent to her Woolly Horses, her Mermaids, her Sea Serpents, her Barnums,1 and her Fanny Ferns;2 but the last monstrous importation from Brooklyn, New York, has scattered our indifference to the winds. Here is a thin quarto volume without an author's name on the title-page; but to atone for which we have a portrait engraved on steel of the notorious individual who is the poet presumptive. This portrait expresses all the features of the hard democrat, and none of the flexile delicacy of the civilised poet. The damaged hat, the rough beard, the naked throat, the shirt exposed to the waist, are each and all presented to show that the man to whom those articles belong scorns the delicate arts of civilisation. The man is the true impersonation of his book—rough, uncouth, vulgar. It was by the merest accident that we discovered the name of this erratic and newest wonder; but at page 29 we find that he is—</p><p>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos,<br>Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual.</p><p>The words 'an American' are a surplusage, 'one of the roughs' too painfully apparent; but what is intended to be conveyed by 'a Kosmos' we cannot tell, unless it means a man who thinks that the fine essence of poetry consists in writing a book which an American reviewer is compelled to declare is 'not to be read aloud to a mixed audience.' We should have passed over this book, Leaves of Grass, with indignant contempt, had not some few Transatlantic critics attempted to 'fix' this Walt Whitman as the poet who shall give a new and independent literature to America—who shall form a race of poets as Banquo's issue formed a line of kings. Is it possible that the most prudish nation in the world will adopt a poet whose indecencies stink in the nostrils? We hope not; and yet there is a probability, and we will show why, that this Walt Whitman will not meet with the stern rebuke which he so richly deserves. America has felt, oftener perhaps than we have declared, that she has no national poet—that each one of her children of song has relied too much on European inspiration, and clung too fervently to the old conventionalities. It is therefore not unlikely that she may believe in the dawn of a thoroughly original literature, now there has arisen a man who scorns the Hellenic deities, who has no belief in, perhaps because he has no knowledge of, Homer and Shakspere; who relies on his own rugged nature, and trusts to his own rugged language, being himself what he shows in his poems. Once transfix him as the genesis of a new era, and the manner of the man may be forgiven or forgotten. But what claim has this Walt Whitman to be thus considered, or to be considered a poet at all? We grant freely enough that he has a strong relish for nature and freedom, just as an animal has; nay, further, that his crude mind is capable of appreciating some of nature's beauties; but it by no means follows that, because nature is excellent, therefore art is contemptible. Walt Whitman is, as unacquainted with art, as a hog is with mathematics. His poems—we must call them so for convenience—twelve in number, are innocent of rhythm, and resemble nothing so much as the war-cry of the Red Indians. Indeed, Walt Whitman has had near and ample opportunities of studying the vociferations of a few amiable savages. Or rather perhaps, this Walt Whitman reminds us of Caliban3 flinging down his logs, and setting himself to write a poem. In fact Caliban, and not Walt Whitman, might have written this:</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed—I too am untranslatable.<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>Is this man with the 'barbaric yawp' to push Longfellow into the shade, and he meanwhile to stand and 'make mouths' at the sun? The chance of this might be formidable were it not ridiculous. That object or that act which most develops the ridiculous element carries in its bosom the seeds of decay, and is wholly powerless to trample out of God's universe one spark of the beautiful. We do not, then, fear this Walt Whitman, who gives us slang in the place of melody, and rowdyism in the place of regularity. The depth of his indecencies will be the grave of his fame, or ought to be if all proper feeling is not extinct. The very nature of this man's compositions excludes us from proving by extracts the truth of our remarks; but we, who are not prudish, emphatically declare that the man who wrote page 79 of the Leaves of Grass deserves nothing so richly as the public executioner's whip. Walt Whitman libels the highest type of humanity, and calls his free speech the true utterance of a man: we, who may have been misdirected by civilisation, call it the expression of a beast.</p><p>The leading idea of Walt Whitman's poems is as old as the hills. It is the doctrine of universal sympathy which the first poet maintained, and which the last on earth will maintain also. He says:</p><p>Not a mutineer walks handcuffed to the jail but I am hand-<br>cuffed to him and walk by his side,<br>Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the<br>last gasp.</p><p>To show this sympathy he instances a thousand paltry, frivolous, and obscene circumstances. Herein we may behold the difference between a great and a contemptible poet. What Shakspere—mighty shade of the mightiest bard, forgive us the comparison —expressed in a single line,</p><p>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</p><p>this Walt Whitman has tortured into scores of pages. A single extract will show what we mean. This miserable spinner of words declares that the earth has 'no themes, or hints, or provokers,' and never had, if you cannot find such themes, or hints, or provokers in</p><p>The veneer and gluepot . . .the confectioner's ornaments . . .the<br>decanter and glasses . . .the shears and flatiron;<br>The awl and kneestrap . . .the pint measure and quart measure<br>. . .the counter and stool . . .the writingpen of quill or metal;<br>Billiards and tenpins . . . . . . the ladders and hanging ropes of<br>the gymnasium, and the manly exercises;<br>The designs for wallpapers or oilcloths or carpets . . . . . . the<br>fancies for goods for women . . . . . . the bookbinder's stamps;<br>Leatherdressing, coachmaking, boilermaking, ropetwisting,<br>distilling, signpainting, limeburning, coopering, cotton-<br>picking,<br>The walkingbeam of the steam-engine . . .the throttle and<br>governors, and the up and down rods,<br>Stavemachines and plainingmachines . . . . . . the cart of the<br>carman . . .the omnibus . . .the ponderous dray;<br>The snowplough and two engines pushing it . . . . . . the ride in<br>the express train of only one car . . . . . . the swift go through<br>a howling storm:<br>The bearhunt or coonhunt . . . . . . the bonfire of shavings in the<br>open lot in the city . . .the crowd of children watching;<br>The blows of the fighting-man . . .the upper cut and one-two-<br>three;<br>The shopwindows . . .the coffins in the sexton's wareroom . . . . . .<br>the fruit on the fruitstand . . . . . . the beef on the butcher's<br>stall,<br>The bread and cakes in the bakery . . . . . . the white and red<br>pork in the pork-store;<br>The milliner's ribbons . . .the dressmaker's patterns . . . . . . the<br>tea-table . . .the home-made sweetmeats:<br>The column of wants in the one-cent paper . . .the news by<br>telegraph . . . . . . the amusements and operas and shows:<br>The cotton and woolen and linen you wear . . . . . . the money<br>you make and spend;<br>Your room and bedroom . . . . . . your piano-forte . . . . . . the stove<br>and cookpans,<br>The house you live in . . . . . . the rent . . . . . . the other tenants . . . . . .<br>the deposite in the savings-bank . . . . . . the trade at the<br>grocery,<br>The pay on Saturday night . . .the going home, and the purchases;</p><p>Can it be possible that its author intended this as a portion of a poem? Is it not more reasonable to suppose that Walt Whitman has been learning to write, and that the compositor has got hold of his copy-book? The American critics are, in the main, pleased with this man because he is self-reliant, and because he assumes all the attributes of his country. If Walt Whitman has really assumed those attributes, America should hasten to repudiate them, be they what they may. The critics are pleased also because he talks like a man unaware that there was ever such a production as a book, or ever such a being as a writer. This in the present day is a qualification exceedingly rare, and may be valuable, so we wish those gentlemen joy of their GREAT UNTAMED.</p><p>We must not neglect to quote an unusual passage, which may be suggestive to writers of the Old World. To silence our incredulous readers, we assure them that the passage may be found at page 92:—</p><p>Is it wonderful that I should be immortal?<br>As every one is immortal, I know it is wonderful; but<br>my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how I was<br>conceived in my mother's womb is equally wonderful.<br>And how I was not palpable once but am now, and was born<br>on the last day of May 1819, and passed from a babe<br>in the creeping trance of three summers and three<br>winters to articulate and walk, are all equally wonderful.<br>And that I grew six feet high, and that I have become a<br>man thirty-six years old in 1855, and that I am here<br>anyhow,are all equally wonderful.</p><p>The transformation and the ethereal nature of Walt Whitman is marvellous to us, but perhaps not so to a nation from which the spirit-rappers sprung.</p><p>I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway<br>I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags;<br>I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass love.<br>If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.</p><p>Here is also a sample of the man's slang and vulgarity:</p><p>This hour I tell things in confidence,<br>I might not tell everybody but I will tell you.<br>Who goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude?<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?<br>What is a man anyhow? What am I? and what are you?<br>All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and<br>filth,<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the<br>end but threadbare crape and tears.</p><p>And here a spice of his republican insolence, his rank Yankeedom, and his audacious trifling with death:</p><p>I rose this morning early to get betimes in Boston town.<br>Here's a good place at the corner. I must stand and see the<br>show.<br>I love to look on the stars and stripes. I hope the fifes will<br>play Yankee Doodle.<br>I will whisper it to the mayor, he shall send a committee to<br>England;<br>They shall get a grant from the Parliament, and go with a<br>cart to the royal vault.<br>Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the<br>grave-clothes, box up his bones for a journey.<br>Find a swift Yankee clipper: here is freight for you, black-<br>bellied clipper.<br>Up with your anchor! shake out your sails, steer straight<br>towards Boston Bay.<br>The committee open the box and set up the regal ribs, and<br>glue those that will not stay,<br>And clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on<br>top of the skull.<br>You have got your revenge, Old Buster!</p><p>We will neither weary nor insult our readers with more extracts from this notable book. Emerson has praised it, and called it the 'most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed.' Because Emerson has grasped substantial fame, he can afford to be generous; but Emerson's generosity must not be mistaken for justice. If this work is really a work of genius—if the principles of those poems, their free language, their amazing and audacious egotism, their animal vigour, be real poetry and the divinest evidence of the true poet—then our studies have been in vain, and vainer still the homage which we have paid the monarchs of Saxon intellect, Shakspere, and Milton, and Byron. This Walt Whitman holds that his claim to be a poet lies in his robust and rude health. He is, in fact, as he declares, 'the poet of the body.' Adopt this theory, and Walt Whitman is a Titan; Shelley and Keats the merest pigmies. If we had commenced a notice of Leaves of Grass in anger, we could not but dismiss it in grief, for its author, we have just discovered, is conscious of his affliction. He says, at page 33,</p><p>I am given up by traitors;<br>I talk wildly, I am mad.</p>",

Many of the lines are such perfect pictures in themselves, that an artist might draw them without reference to any other material, and produce beautiful pictorial compositions. Other portions of the book are perfectly kaleidoscopic—grotesque changes rapidly succeed each other; and no one save the author himself—and he, perhaps, not an exception—can explain them.

No. It were a spectacle worth seeing, this glorious Native American, who, when the daily labor of chisel and plane was over, him-self, with toil-hardened fingers, handled the types to print the pages which wise and good men have since delighted to endorse and to honor. Small critics, whose contracted vision could see no beauty, strength, or grace, in these 'Leaves,' have long ago repented that they so hastily wrote themselves down shallow by such a premature confession. Where an Emerson, and a Howitt have commended, my woman's voice of praise may not avail; but happiness was born a twin, and so I would fain share with others the unmingled delight which these 'Leaves' have given me.</p><p>I say unmingled; I am not unaware that the charge of coarseness and sensuality has been affixed to them. My moral constitution may be hopelessly tainted or—too sound to be tainted, as the critic wills, but I confess that I extract no poison from these Leaves—to me they have brought only healing. Let him who can do so, shroud the eyes of the nursing babe lest it should see its mother's breast. Let him look carefully between the gilded covers of books, backed by high-sounding names, and endorsed by parson and priest, lying unrebuked upon his own family table; where the asp of sensuality lies coiled amid rhetorical flowers. Let him examine well the paper dropped weekly at his door, in which virtue and religion are rendered disgusting, save when they walk in satin slippers, or, clothed in purple and fine linen, kneel on a damask 'prie-dieu.'</p><p>Sensual!—No—the moral assassin looks you not boldly in the eye by broad daylight; but Borgia-like2 takes you treacherously by the hand, while from the glittering ring on his finger he distils through your veins the subtle and deadly poison.</p><p>Sensual?

	"body": "<p>Leaves of Grass (Brooklyn, New York: 1855. London: Horsell.)</p><p>—'Latter-day poetry' in America is of a very different character from the same manifestation in the old country. Here, it is occupied for the most part with dreams of the middle ages, of the old knightly and religious times: in America, it is employed chiefly with the present, except when it travels out into the undiscovered future. Here, our latter-day poets are apt to whine over the times, as if Heaven were perpetually betraying the earth with a show of progress that is in fact retrogression, like the backward advance of crabs: there, the minstrels of the stars and stripes blow a loud note of exultation before the grand new epoch, and think the Greeks and Romans, the early Oriental races, and the later men of the middle centuries, of small account before the onward tramping of these present generations. Of this latter sect is a certain phenomenon who has recently started up in Brooklyn, New York—one Walt Whitman, author of Leaves of Grass, who has been received by a section of his countrymen as a sort of prophet, and by Englishmen as a kind of fool. For ourselves, we are not disposed to accept him as the one, having less faith in latter-day prophets than in latter-day poets; but assuredly we cannot regard him as the other. Walt is one of the most amazing, one of the most startling, one of the most perplexing, creations of the modern American mind; but he is no fool, though abundantly eccentric, nor is his book mere food for laughter, though undoubtedly containing much that may most easily and fairly be turned into ridicule.</p><p>The singularity of the author's mind—his utter disregard of ordinary forms and modes—appears in the very title-page and frontispiece of his work. Not only is there no author's name (which in itself would not be singular), but there is no publisher's name—that of the English bookseller being a London addition. Fronting the title is the portrait of a bearded gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and a Spanish hat, with an all-pervading atmosphere of Yankee-doodle about him; but again there is no patronymic, and we can only infer that this roystering blade is the author of the book. Then follows a long prose treatise by way of Preface (and here once more the anonymous system is carried out, the treatise having no heading whatever); and after that we have the poem, in the course of which, a short autobiographical discourse reveals to us the name of the author.</p><p>A passage from the Preface, if it may be so called, will give some insight into the character and objects of the work. The dots do not indicate any abbreviation by us, but are part of the author's singular system of punctuation:—</p><p><em>Other states indicate themselves in their deputies…but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors…but always most in the common people. Their manners speech dress friendships—the freshness and candour of their physiognomy—the picturesque looseness of their carriage…their deathless attachment to freedom—their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft, or mean—the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states—the fierceness of their roused resentment—their curiosity and welcome of novelty—their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy—their susceptibility to a slight—the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors—the fluency of their speech—their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul…their good temper and open-handedness—the terrible significance of their elections—the President's taking off his hat to them not they to him—these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</em></p><p>This 'gigantic and generous treatment,' we presume, is offered in the pages which ensue. The poem is written in wild, irregular, unrhymed, almost unmetrical 'lengths,' like the measured prose of Mr. Martin Farquhar Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, or of some of the Oriental writings. The external form, therefore, is startling, and by no means seductive, to English ears, accustomed to the sumptuous music of ordinary metres; and the central principle of the poem is equally staggering. It seems to resolve itself into an all-attracting egotism—an eternal presence of the individual soul of Walt Whitman in all things, yet in such wise that this one soul shall be presented as a type of all human souls whatsoever. He goes forth into the world, this rough, devil-may-care Yankee; passionately identifies himself with all forms of being, sentient or inanimate; sympathizes deeply with humanity; riots with a kind of Bacchanal fury in the force and fervour of his own sensations; will not have the most vicious or abandoned shut out from final comfort and reconciliation; is delighted with Broadway, New York, and equally in love with the desolate backwoods, and the long stretch of the uninhabited prairie, where the wild beasts wallow in the reeds, and the wilder birds start upwards from their nests among the grass; perceives a divine mystery wherever his feet conduct or his thoughts transport him; and beholds all beings tending towards the central and sovereign Me. Such, as we conceive, is the key to this strange, grotesque, and bewildering book; yet we are far from saying that the key will unlock all the quirks and oddities of the volume. Much remains of which we confess we can make nothing; much that seems to us purely fantastical and preposterous; much that appears to our muddy vision gratuitously prosaic, needlessly plain-speaking, disgusting without purpose, and singular without result. There are so many evidences of a noble soul in Whitman's pages that we regret these aberrations, which only have the effect of discrediting what is genuine by the show of something false; and especially do we deplore the unnecessary openness with which Walt reveals to us matters which ought rather to remain in a sacred silence. It is good not to be ashamed of Nature; it is good to have an all-inclusive charity; but it is also good, sometimes, to leave the veil across the Temple.</p><p>That the reader may be made acquainted with the vividness with which Walt can paint the unhackneyed scenery of his native land, we subjoin a panorama:—</p><p>By the city's quadrangular houses . . . in log-huts, or camping with lumber-men,<br>Along the ruts of the turnpike . . . along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,<br>Hoeing my onion-patch, and rows of carrots and parsnips . . . crossing savannas . . <br>trailing in forests,<br>Prospecting . . . gold-digging . . . girdling the trees of a new purchase,<br>Scorched ankle-deep by the hot sand . . . hauling my boat down the shallow river;<br>Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead . . . where the buck turns <br>furiously at the hunter,<br>Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock . . . where the otter is feed-<br>ing on fish,<br>Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,<br>Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey . . . where the beaver pats the <br>mud with his paddle-tail;<br>Over the growing sugar . . . over the cotton plant . . . over the rice in its low, <br>moist field;<br>Over the sharp-peaked farmhouse with its scalloped scum and slender shoots from the <br>gutters;<br>Over the western persimmon . . . over the long-leaved corn and the delicate blue<br> flowered flax;<br>Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and a buzzer there with the rest,<br>Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;<br>Scaling mountains . . . pulling myself cautiously up . . . holding on by low <br>scragged limbs,<br>Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush;<br>Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot,<br>Where the bat flies in the July eve . . . where the great goldbug drops through the <br>dark;<br>Where the flails keep time on the barn floor,<br>Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,<br>Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,<br>Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, and andirons straddle the hearth-slab, <br>and cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;<br>Where triphammers crash . . . where the press is whirling its cylinders;<br>Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes out of its ribs.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Bothwell: A Poem in six parts By W. Edmonstoune Aytoun, D. C. L., Author of 'Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers, &c,'1 W. Blackwood and Sons. Edinburgh and London, 1856.</p><p>Leaves of Grass Brooklyn, New York, 1855.</p><p>In the works named above we have two not unmete representatives of the extremes of the Old and of the New World poetic ideal: 'Bothwell,' the product of the severely critical, refined, and ultra-conservative author of the Lays of the 'Scottish Cavaliers;' and 'Leaves of Grass,' the wild, exuberant, lawless offspring of Walt Whitman, a Brooklyn Boy, 'One of the Roughs!'</p><p>In contrast with this we have named the effusions of the Brooklyn Bard. If the accredited author of 'Firmilian' has now shown us what a poem ought to be, assuredly Walt Whitman is wide of the mark. Externally and internally he sets all law, decorum, prosody and propriety at defiance. A tall, lean, sallow, most republican, and Yankee-looking volume, is his 'Leaves of grass; full of egotism, extravagance, and spasmodic eccentricities of all sorts; and heralded by a sheaf of double-columned extracts from Reviews—not always the least curious of its singular contents. Here, for example, is a protest against the intrusion of the British muse on the free soil of the States of the Union, which must surely satisfy the most clamant demand for native poetics and republican egotism:</p><p>'What very properly fits a subject of the British crown, may fit very ill an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect, is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; everything receives its tinge from that. In the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakespeare, just as much as the rest, there is the air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakespeare represented in America, is not an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone—never silent in their plots and characters—be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson was the most enormous of liars, and common persons, North and South, should bow low to their betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops.'</p><p>—and here accordingly is something essentially different from all poets, both old and new.</p><p>The poet, unnamed on his title page, figures on his frontispiece, and unmistakeably utters his own poem:</p><p>'I celebrate myself,<br>And what I assume, you shall assume;<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>I loafe, and invite my soul;<br>I lean and loafe at my ease—<br>Observing a spear of Summer grass.'</p><p>Such is the starting point of this most eccentric and republican of poets; of whom the republican critic above quoted, after contrasting with him Tennyson, as 'The bard of ennui, and the aristocracy and their combination into love, the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakespeare, the same as the rest.'—concludes by confessing his inability to decide whether Walt Whitman is 'to prove the most lamentable of failures, or the most glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature.'</p><p>Assuredly, the Brooklyn poet is no commonplace writer. That he is startling and outré, no one who opens his volume will doubt. The conventionalities, and proprieties, and modesties, of thought, as well as of language, hold him in no restraint; and hence he has a vantage ground from which he may claim such credit as its licence deserves. But, apart from this, there are unmistakeable freshness, originality, and true poetic gleams of thought, mingled with the strange incoherencies of his boastful rhapsody. To call his 'Leaves' poems, would be a mistake; they resemble rather the poet's first jottings, out of which the poem is to be formed; the ore out of which the metal is to be smelted; and, in its present form, with more of dross than sterling metal in the mass.</p><p>To find an extractable passage is no easy task. Here a fine suggestive fancy ends in some offensive pruriency; there it dwindles into incomprehensible aggregations of words and terms, which—unless Machiavelli was right in teaching that words were given us to conceal our thoughts,—are mere clotted nonsense! Were we disposed to ridicule: our selections would be easy enough; or gravely to censure: abundant justification is at hand. We rather cull—not without needful omissions—the thoughts that seem to have suggested the quaint title of 'Leaves of Grass'.</p><p>'Loafe with me on the grass…loose the stop from your throat,<br>Not words, not music or rhyme I want: not custom or lecture, not even the best,<br>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>I know that the hand of God is the elderhand of my own,<br>And I know that the spirit of God is the eldest brother of my own,<br>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers…and the women <br>my sisters and lovers,<br>And that a kelson of the Creation is love;<br>And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields.<br>A child said, what is the Grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child?…I do not know what it is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green <br>stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropped,<br>Bearing the owner's name some way in the corners, that we may see and <br>remark, and say Whose?<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child…the produced babe of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, Sprouting, alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressmen, Cuff,<br>I give them the same, I receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>All truths wait in all things,<br>They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,<br>They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,<br>The insignificant is as big to me as any,<br>Logic and sermons never convince,<br>The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars,<br>And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of <br>the wren,<br>And the tree-toad is a chef-d' uvre for the highest,<br>And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,<br>And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,<br>And the cow crunching with depressed head surpasses any statue,<br>And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.'</p><p>This passage is far from being the most characteristic of the poem, and even in it we have stopped abruptly for one line more, and…Yet this will show that the punctuation is as odd as any other feature of the work; for the whole is full of conceits which speak fully as much of coarse vain-glorious egotism as of originality of genius. Any man may be an original, whether in the fopperies of the dress he puts on himself or on his poem. We are not, therefore, disposed to rate such very high, or to reckon Walt Whitman's typographical whims any more indicative of special genius, than the shirt-sleeves and unshaven chin of his frontispiece. If they indicate any thing specially, we should infer that he is a compositor by trade, and, for all his affectations of independence, could not keep 'the shop' out of his verse. But that he sets all the ordinary rules of men and poets at defiance is visible on every page of his lank volume; and if readers judge thereby that he thinks himself wiser than all previous men and poets—we have no authority to contradict them. That some of his thoughts are far from vain or common place, however, a few gleanings may suffice to prove; culled in the form, not of detached passages but of isolated ideas—line, or fragments of lines:—</p><p>'The friendly and flowing savage…Who is he?<br>Is he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it?'</p><p>―――</p><p>'The welcome ugly face of some beautiful soul.'</p><p>'The clock indicates the moment…but what does eternity indicate?'</p><p>―――</p><p>'Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, the vapor from the nostrils of death,<br>I know I was even there…I waited unseen and always,<br>And slept while God carried me through the lethargic mist,<br>And took my time…and took no hurt from the foetid carbon.'</p><p>―――</p><p>'See ever so far…there is limitless space outside of that,<br>Count ever so much…there is limitless time around that.<br>Our rendezvous is fitly appointed…God will be there and wait till we come.'</p><p>These doubled and quadrupled points, let us add, pertain to the original, whatever their precise significance may be. Here again is a grand idea, not altogether new; and rough in its present setting, as the native gold still buried in Californian beds of quartz and debris. Nevertheless it is full of suggestive thought, and like much else in the volume—though less than most,—only requires the hand of the artist to cut, and polish, and set, that it may gleam and sparkle with true poetic lustre:—</p><p>'A slave at auction!<br>I help the auctioneer…the sloven does not half know his business.<br>Gentlemen look on this curious creature,<br>Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for him,<br>For him the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or <br>plant,<br>For him the revolving cycles truly and steadily rolled.<br>In that head the allbaffling brain,<br>In it and below it the making of the attributes of heroes.<br>Examine these limbs, red, black or white…they are very cunning in tendon <br>and nerve;<br>They shall be stript that you may see them.<br>Exquisite senses, lifelit eyes, pluck, volition,<br>Flakes of breastmuscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good <br>sized arms and legs,<br>And wonders within there yet.<br>Within there runs his blood…the same old blood…the <br>same red running blood<br>There swells and jets his heart…There all passions and desires…all <br>reachings and aspirations:<br>Do you think they are not there because they are not expressed in parlors <br>and lecture-rooms?<br>This is not only one man…he is the father of those who shall be fathers in <br>their turns,<br>In him the start of populous states and rich republics,<br>Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.<br>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through <br>the centuries?<br>Who might you find you have come from yourself?'</p><p>'Great is life…and real and mystical…wherever and whoever,<br>Great is death…sure as life holds all parts together, death holds all parts <br>together;<br>Sure as the stars return again after they merge in the light, death is greater <br>than life.'</p><p>Such are some of the 'Leaves of Grass,' of the Brooklyn poet who describes himself in one of them as:</p><p>'Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a Kosmos!'</p><p>But if the reader—recognising true poetry in some of these,—should assume such a likeness running through the whole as pertains to the blades of Nature's Grass, we disclaim all responsibility if he find reason to revise his fancy. In the two very diverse volumes under review it seems to us that we have in the one the polish of the artist, which can accomplish so much when applied to the gem or rich ore; in the other we discern the ore, but overlaid with the valueless matrix and foul rubbish of the mine, and devoid of all the unveiling beauties of art. Viewed in such aspects these poems are characteristic of the age. From each we have striven to select what appeared most worthy of the space at command, and best calculated to present them to the reader in the most favorable point of view consistent with truth. And so we leave the reader to his own judgment, between the old-world stickler for authority, precedent, and poetical respectability, and the new-world contemner of all authorities, laws, and respectabilities whatsoever. Happily for us, all choice is not necessarily limited to these. The golden mean of poesie does not, we imagine, lie between such extremes. There are not a few left, both in England and in America, for whom old Shakspeare is still respectable enough, and poetical enough,—aye and free enough too, in spite of all the freedom which has budded and bloomed since that year 1616, when his sacred ashes were laid beneath the chancel stone whose curse still guards them from impious hands. Nevertheless we have faith in the future. We doubt not even the present. When a greater poet than Shakespeare does arrive we shall not count him an impossibility.</p><p>D.W.</p>",

The only review we shall attempt of it, will be to thus publicly call the attention of the grand jury to a matter that needs presentment by them, and to mildly suggest that the author should be sent to a lunatic asylum, and the mercenary publishers to the penitentiary for pandering to the prurient tastes of morbid sensualists.

Affectation is as pitiful an ambition in literature as alliteration, and never has it been more fully exhibited during the present century than in the case of Thomas Carlyle, a man with an order of intellect approaching genius, but who for a distinguishing mark to point like a finger-board to himself, left a very terse and effective style of writing to adopt a jargon filled with new-fangled phrases and ungrammatical super-superlative adjectives—Mr. Carlyle buried himself for a long time in German universities and German philosophy, and came forth clothed in a full 'old clothes' suit of transcendentalism worthy of the Chatham street embodiments of that pseudo-philosophy, Kant and Spinosa [sic]—Carlyle by this operation became a full-fledged Psyche from the chrysalis, and sported in the sunshine of popularity, whereupon a young gentleman ambitious of making New England an umbra of Scottish-Germanic glory, one Ralph Waldo Emerson, suddenly transforms himself into a metaphysical transcendentalist and begins talking about 'Objective and Subjective,' the 'Inner and Outer,' the 'Real and Ideal,' the 'God-heads and God-tails,' 'Planes,' 'Spheres,' 'Finite, Infinite,' 'Unities,' and 'Dualities,' 'Squills, Ipecac,' 'Cascading and Cavorting,' &, & And lo! another appeared after this Mr. Emerson, one Walt Whitman, who kicked over the whole bucket of the Milky Way, and deluged the world with the whey, curds and bonny-clabber of Brooklyn—which has resulted from the turning of the milk of human kindness in a 'b'hoy's' brains to the cream of Tartar—and a delicious dish of the same is now furnished under cover of Leaves of Grass, and indorsed by the said Emerson, who swallows down Whitman's vulgarity and beastliness as if they were curds and whey.
