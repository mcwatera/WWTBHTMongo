When Walt Whitman was welcomed to Olympus a quarter of a century ago, his greatness was as secure as it is today, when he is acknowledged by the people whose greatness inspires his verse. In all quarters of the Union, North, South, East and West, Walt Whitman has the warmest personal friends who, if they have not met him face to face, have felt the grasp of his hand in his words. No other man has expressed his personality so strongly in his poems. One of the best characterizations of 'Leaves of Grass' is that of a lady, who said: 'It does not read like a book; it seems like a man.' The publication of the complete poems of Walt Whitman by one of the leading publishers of the United States is a literary event, for through it the greatest American poet has come to the birthright denied him so long. It has, indeed, mattered little to him, for he has bided his time patiently and serenely, and when such captains of the mind as Emerson and Tennyson reached out their hands in friendly recognition, he could rest satisfied that the multitude would some day acknowledge the prophet hailed by those leaders. The date of the following lines seem remote enough:</p><p>CONCORD, Mass., July. 1855.</p><p>Dear Sir: I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of the 'Leaves of Grass.' I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork or too much lymph in the temperament were making our western wits fat and mean. I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p><p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a stint. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion, but the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging. I did not know, until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper, that I could trust the name as real and available for the postoffice. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.</p><p>R. W. Emerson.</p><p>Though these words were afterward somewhat taken back—a little Galileo-like, through fear of the New England pope called prudery—it was the true Emerson who spoke his heart then. 'Leaves of Grass' have been harvested several times and bound in sheaves of various form, from the quaint first edition, which was both body and soul, the work of Walt Whitman, to that of the New York Publisher who was so frightened at what he had done that he</p><p><em>BACKED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE;</em></p><p>that of the Boston publisher, which has been the standard for many years because of the implied demand; the personal edition published by the poet himself; one or more of the English editions, and now at last the edition just published by James R. Osgood & Co., a compact volume of 382 pages, with all the elements of attractive typography, binding form and price needed for the great popular success which the work is sure to achieve. That beside its assured hearty reception the book will be much maligned and ridiculed is a matter of course, for as it is read more so will there be more opposition to its lessons. But it is a test of greatness that ridicule it as much as you will, the ridicule will not stick. Walt Whitman has survived the great storms that have assailed him and his fame is secure from the pattering of little showers.</p><p>The new edition contains all his poems; the only changes that have been made are in the way of condensation of utterance. There are, also, something like 20 new poems printed direct from the manuscript. There is more of a rounding and completeness of the work; the all embracing patriotism which forms one of the poet's grandest characteristics is more comprehensive than ever before manifested. Walt Whitman did yeoman service for the Union in the hospitals of the field during the war, and he loves the whole Union. He has a warm place in his heart for the South, and it is manifested on many pages of this new edition. He writes:</p><p>'I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the <br>wise,<br>Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br>Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<br>Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with <br>stuff that is fine.<br>One of the nation of many nations, the smallest the same <br>and the largest the same,<br>A southerner soon as a northerner.'</p><p>The titles of a number of poems have been changed, notably that of the great poem of the work, that which strikes the key note of the volume, 'Walt Whitman,' being now known as 'Song of Myself.' At the beginning of this song is a portrait of the poet as he was when 'Leaves of Grass' was gestating, a steel engraving from an old daguerreotype taken in 1856 when Walt Whitman was 37 years old. He was then a carpenter, building and selling cottage houses in Brooklyn, and the picture was taken impromptu one warm June afternoon by Gabriel Harrison. The picture is well described by the lines:</p><p>'Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I <br>am,<br>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, <br>unitary,<br>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpa-<br>ble certain rest.<br>Looking with side-curved head curious what will come <br>next.<br>Both in and out of the game, and watching and wondering <br>at it.'</p><p><em>THE OLD OBJECTIONS</em></p><p>will, of course, be brought up. Many will say they agree with the ideas, but what is the use of printing them in the shape of poetry? Because it reads better that way, and it is poetry of the noblest kind, may be answered. Why is it that so many still insist that conventional form is necessary to poetry? Do they admire flowers most, or the vase? In Milton's day many maintained that 'Paradise Lost' was not a poem because it was not in rhyme. In the 'Leaves of Grass' the blades are of unequal length, but they are ever fresh and beautiful, and full of sweet nutriment. Thought, and truth, and strength, and nobility, and grand proportions, whose symmetry belittles inequalities of metre, are all there, and rhythmic swing is there. Is anything more needed for poetry?</p><p>One of the great features of Walt Whitman is that he does not seek his ideals in far away times, which stripped of their glamour of, remoteness, are but as the times of today; or, in supreme moments, he idealizes the commonplace, and has the clearness of vision that discerns the gleam of gold through all the accumulated dross.</p><p>The large and the magnificent tolerance that includes all and allows for all, and finds a place for all, is a sublime characteristic of the man. There is so much in these lines that they cannot be packed into layers of equal length. The book teems with the ecstasy of being. The statement of details into which the poet now and then drops has been criticised as 'cataloging.' But viewed with the poet's intention, what a mosaic picture of the people, of the nation and its races, is thus constituted! One sees the stir and hears the hum of the entire land; feels the pulse of the multitude. What is the use of attempting to depict such a thing—it can't be all shown. But the effect is like a gleam of sunshine in the depths of a forest; it reveals many things with vivid distinctness; there is a vast reserve of hidden things which might be seen, but enough is shown to tell what is there—to give the character of the place. Do not these fragments, picked from different parts of the country, at random, give an idea of what the life of that country is:</p><p>'The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the <br>wharf or levee,<br>As the wooly-pates hoe in the sugar field, the over-<br>seer views them from his saddle.<br>The bugle calls in the bedroom, the gentlemen run for <br>their partners, the dancers bow to each other.<br>The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and <br>harks to the musical rain,<br>The wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill <br>the Huron.<br>The squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth, is offer-<br>ing mocassin and bead bars for sale,<br>The connoisseur peers along the exhibition gallery, <br>with half-shut eyes bent sideways.'</p><p><em>THE WANT OF ARTISTIC GRACE</em></p><p>in form is compensated for by the artistic picturesqueness of form; in a measure, the poet makes pictures of his poems, and thus strengthens their individuality. For instance, the frequent use of italics and parentheses and the choice of odd words now and then—a bit of Spanish or French. Camerado and Libertad are favorites. These foreign words and phrases seem to depict unassimilated fragments floating on the life-current of the nation.</p><p>Many intelligent people fail to comprehend; they can't see what the poet is driving at—it is all so strange and unwanted, or unlike previous models. They get too close to the canvass; they see nothing but paint and brush marks; they do not take it all in—they do not see the picture. What a daring use of color! Only a strong man could wield such a brush. Should a weaker man attempt such bold figures; he would make himself ridiculous; it would seem like affectation, as it would should he wear unconventional dress. But Walt Whitman can carry it off. He looks exceeding well in his broad hat, wide collar and suit of modest gray. We all want more freedom of movement, but he can afford to take it and is not afraid. Read this vivid description of a sunrise:</p><p>'To behold the day-break!<br>The little light fades the immense and diaphanous <br>shadows.<br>The air tastes good to my palate.<br>Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently <br>rising freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.<br>Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous <br>prongs,<br>Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.'</p><p>And this from one of the many pictures of death:</p><p>'And as to you, corpse, I think you are good manure, <br>but that does not offend me.<br>I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing.<br>I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts<br> of melons.'</p><p>There is much that will not be understood by many, much to which many will object, but as willing guests who approach a beautifully spread table, upon which are dishes which some like and dislike, and others again can learn to like—there is enough of grandeur and beauty and truth, so that every body can</p><p><em>TAKE AWAY SOMETHING TO HIS TASTE.</em></p><p>The poems are not to be accepted too literally, and the poet understood to be doing or wishing to do everything which is spoken of under the cover of the first person—he simply expresses his capacity to feel universally; he impersonates all humanity in himself, puts himself in its place, and surveys the universe from his standpoint—as everyone is to himself the central point of the world.</p><p>'I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up the <br>time while I wait for a boat,<br>(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the <br>tongue of you,<br>Tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosen'd).'</p><p>Walt Whitman is the poet of evolution—modern science finds its prophet in him. He conjoins materialism with ideality. He is religious in the largest sense.</p><p>'Each is not for its own sake,<br>I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are <br>for religion's sake.</p><p>I say no man has ever been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, <br>and how certain the future is.'</p><p>The course of the 'Song of Myself' is like that of a noble drama, and it has the sublimest moments in its culmination. How sound physical health asserts itself here:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they are<br>so placid and self-contain'd,<br>I stand and look at them long and long.</p><p>They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their <br>sins.<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty to <br>God,<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the <br>mania of owning things.<br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived <br>thousands of years ago.<br>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole <br>earth.'</p><p>What an omnisciently inspired and sustained note in the passages beginning with the following:</p><p>'I heard what was said of the universe,<br>I heard it and heard it of several thousand years;<br>It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all!</p><p>Magnifying and applying come I,<br>Outbidding at the start the old cautions hucksters,<br>Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,<br>Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his <br>grandson.<br>Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,<br>In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf,<br> the crucifix engraved.<br>With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every <br>idol and image,<br>Taking them all for what they are worth and not a <br>cent more.'</p><p>'I do not despise you priest, all time, the world over,<br>My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of <br>faiths.<br>Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between <br>ancient and modern.'</p><p>'Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like <br>cheerful boatmen.<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings.<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.<br>Before I was born out of my mother generations <br>guided me.<br>My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could <br>overlay it.<br>For it the nebula cohered to an orb,<br>The long, slow strata piled to rest it on.<br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance.<br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and <br>deposited it with care.</p><p>All forces have been steadily employed to complete <br>and delight me,<br>Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.'</p><p><em>WAS EVER THE COURSE OF CREATION</em></p><p>more concisely and grandly stated? Does it not make old fables turn pale? It is a lofty height from which all this is said down to the world. Taking the national side of the poet, were the local names ever more truthfully or poetically expressed than in the following:</p><p>'The red aborigines,<br>Leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, <br>calls as of birds and animals in the woods, syllabled to us <br>for names.<br>Okonee, Koosa, Ottawa, Monongahela, Sauk, Natchez,<br> Chattahoochee, Kaqueta, Oronoco,<br>Wabash, Miami, Saginaw, Chippewa, Oshkosh, Walla- <br>Walla.<br>Leaving such to the States they melt, they depart, <br>charging the water and the land with names.'</p><p>It is interesting to note some of the favorite passages of the poet's most eminent admirers. The lines previously quoted, 'I heard what was said of the universe,' are especially admired by J. T. Trowbridge, who knows them by heart. The favorite passage of the late Prof. Clifford, the Englishman, who was one of the first to introduce the poet to transatlantic audiences were the glowing lines to night:</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing<br> night,<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.<br>Press close bare-bosom'd night—press close magnetic <br>nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.</p><p>Smile, O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains<br>misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer <br>for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blossom'd <br>earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.</p><p>Prodigal you have given me love—therefore, I to you <br>give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love.'</p><p>The favorite poem of Charles Sumner was the first one under the head of 'Sea Drift,' the idyl of sunny loveliness, called 'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking.' The poem is too long to quote here, but here is one of its lyrics, the song of two mated birds, 'Two Feathered Guests from Alabama':</p><p>Shine! shine! shine!<br>Pour down your warmth great sun!<br>While we bask, we two together.</p><p>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north.<br>Day come white, or night come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,<br>Singing all time, minding all time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Of the poems here collected for the first time that written in Platte canon, Colorado, amid its awful ruggedness and grandeur, is a magnificent justification of the poet's methods:</p><p>Spirit that form'd this scene,<br>These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked <br>freshness.<br>These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,<br>I know thee, savage spirit—we have communed to-<br>gether.<br>Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own.<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten <br>art?<br>To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delica <br>tesse?<br>The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's <br>grace—column and polish'd arch forgot?<br>But thou that revelest here—spirit that form'd this <br>scene,<br>They have remember'd thee.</p><p><em>IN 'ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA'</em></p><p>a charming picture is given of the effect of music on a quiet evening at a solitary frontier post. All familiar with the plains will respond to the chord here struck:</p><p>Through the soft evening air enwinding all,<br>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless <br>wilds.<br>In dulcet streams in flutes' and cornets' notes,<br>Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial.<br>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown <br>before,<br>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, re-<br>lated here,<br>Not to the city's frescoed rooms, not to the audience <br>of the opera house.<br>Sounds echoes, wandering strains, as really here at <br>home.<br>Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's an-<br>guish.<br>And thy ecstatic chorus, Poliuto;)<br>Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br>Music, Italian music in Dakota.<br>While Nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,<br>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br>Acknowledging rapport, however far removed,<br>(As some old root or soil of earth its last-born flower <br>or fruit).<br>Listens well pleas'd.</p><p>In the lines to Gen. Grant, returned from his world's tour, he says that what best he sees in him is not the tribute paid to him, but that in his walks with kings the prairie sovereigns of the West, 'Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world's promenade, were all so justified.' Others of these new poems, full of beauty, are 'Thou orb aloft full dazzling' (which was rejected by a leading editor last summer, on the ground that his readers would not understand it), 'To the Man-of-War Bird,' 'Patrolling Barnegat,' 'My Picture Gallery,' 'The Prairie States,' a tribute to Custer's memory called 'From far Dakota's canons,' 'A Riddle Song,' inspired by the mystery of life, and the following tender, reverential lines to his mother's memory:</p><p><em>AS AT THY PORTALS ALSO, DEATH.</em></p><p>As at thy portals also, death.<br>Entering thy sovereign, dim, illimitable grounds.<br>To memories of my mother, to the divine blending, <br>maternity,<br>To her, buried and gone, yet buried not, gone not from <br>me,<br>(I see again the calm benignant face, fresh and <br>beautiful still,<br>I sit by the form in the coffin.<br>I kiss, and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips,<br> the cheeks, the closed eyes in the coffin).<br>To her, the ideal woman, practical, spiritual, of all of<br> earth, life, love, to me the best,<br>I grave a monumental line before I go, amid these songs,<br>And set a tombstone here.</p><p>Face to face with lines which approach the grave with such classic nobility of step, who can say that Walt Whitman is not a poet? A thoughtful writer of German birth and education, but living today in America, has said that some of the main features and themes of 'Leaves of Grass' may be designated as individuality, inevitable law, physical health, modernness, open air nature, democracy, comradeship, the indissoluble union, good will to other lands, respect to the past, grandeur of labor, perfect state equality, with modernness like a canopy over all, and a resumption of the old Greek ideas of nudity and the divinity of the body, with the Hebrew sacredness of paternity, while the war, the sea, the night, the south and poems of death are also frequently recurring themes. His treatment of the last mentioned theme is specially notable in the 'Memories of President Lincoln.' In the stately elegy which begins these memories, 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed,' the threading of the theme shows a high dramatic instinct. As the singer walks the night with the knowledge of death and the thought of death as companions, the warble of the gray-brown bird singing in the swamp the song of death pervades it all. The notes recur like the motive of a symphony, and at last</p><p><em>THE SONG BREAKS FORTH:</em></p><p>Come lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriv-<br>ing,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate death.<br>Prais'd be the fathomless universe.<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curi-<br>ous,<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.<br>Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, <br>come unfalteringly.</p><p>The foregoing lines are but a part of the bird song. Another song on the death of Lincoln, 'Oh Captain! My Captain!' is already established as a popular American classic.</p><p>The poet Stedman, in a recent article, used the unfortunate expression that his appreciative criticism on 'Walt Whitman,' printed in Scribner's some months ago, was churlishly received. The writer chances to know that Mr. Stedman has somehow sadly misapprehended the state of the case. Mr. Whitman has the warmest personal regard for Mr. Stedman, of whom he speaks with a genuine liking, and he felt the real worth of Mr. Stedman's article, but he also felt that Mr. Stedman had failed to grasp the wholeness of the work, though no finer characterization of the parts could be found. 'Leaves of Grass' is a kosmos, and the leaving out of that which Mr. Stedman, in common with many, finds objectionable, would make it like an imperfect body. One of the greatest of living authors, in speaking with the writer about that passage in Mr. Stedman's article, where it was stated that nature always covered up her bare and ugly spots, and that, therefore, such did not belong in the field of poetry, said that there were times when nature was bare and ugly, that it was the province of art to be truthful to nature, and that genius could treat these themes without offence. In all Walt Whitman there is no more evil thought than in the sprouting of a bud or the wafting of pollen on the wings of springtime. Fortunately it is based upon a law more stable than the fickle suffrages of the multitude, or the wishes of those who would have had him write differently, and, therefore, but partially true.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman. The Man and His Book—Some New Gems for His Admirers",
	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>———</p><p>The Man and His Book—Some New Gems for His Admirers.</p><p>The 'good grey poet' but a few days since left Boston, where he has been for some weeks past staying and busying himself with revising the proof-sheets of the new edition of his famous book, 'Leaves of Grass,' which is soon to be issued by James R. Osgood & Co. of this city. Mr. Whitman, though now nearly 68 years of age, is still hale and vigorous, both in body and mind. The shock of paralysis which he sometime ago experienced still causes him some inconvenience, but does not prevent his moving about, and his striking face and imposing figure, in its somewhat odd dress, has become quite familiar to people of the West End, where he has resided. All who came in contact with the venerable poet were charmed by his cheery kindness, his wit and humor and his intelligent conversation. He has by no means ceased to write, and during the last two or three weeks of his stay in Boston produced several new pieces, which will appear for the first time in the new edition of his poems. Mr. Whitman is eminently the poet of passing events. He does not seek for a grand subject for his muse, but being of a poetic nature he sees the poetry that exists in events almost commonplace. They suggest a poetic thought, and he gives it expression in his own peculiar style. In fact, the most of his short poems are but the expression of a single thought. As an illustration of Mr. Whitman's grasping an idea, may be instanced his poem, entitled, 'The Sobbing of the Bells,' first published in the POST. Mr. Whitman was awakened by the tolling of the bells announcing the death of President Garfield. He appreciated the pathos of the event, and rising, wrote the few lines which so beautifully expressed the sentiment, and which have already become famous. Mr. Whitman's poems have been severely criticized, but much of the criticism is due to a failure to understand. Whether his peculiar style of expression is to be commended or not may be a question, but the beauty of the thoughts expressed cannot be denied. Among the new poems to appear in the volume we take the privilege of quoting a few. The following lines, suggested by hearing a regimental band in the wilds of the far west, is another illustration of Mr. Whitman's ability to see the poetry of ordinary events:</p><p><em>ITALIAN MUSIC IN DAKOTA.</em></p><p>['The Seventeenth—the finest Regimental band I<br> ever heard.']<br>Through the soft evening air enwinding all,<br>Rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless <br>wilds,<br>In dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes,<br>Electric, pensive, turbulent, artificial,<br>(Yet strangely fitting even here, meaning unknown <br>before.<br>Subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here,<br>related here,<br>Not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience<br>of the opera house.<br>Sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at<br>home,<br>Sonnambula's innocent love, trios with Norma's an-<br>guish,<br>And thy ecstatic chorus Pelinto;)<br>Ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown,<br>Music, Italian music in Dakota.</p><p>While nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm,<br>Lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses,<br>Acknowledging rapport however far remove'd,<br>(As some old root or soul of earth its last-born <br>flower or fruit),<br>Listens well pleas'd.</p><p>Another, a bit of description, is in a style well adapted to the grand scene described.</p><p><em>SPIRIT THAT FORM'D THIS SCENE.</em></p><p>[Written in Platte Canon, Colorado.]<br>Spirit that form'd this scene,<br>These tumbled rock piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent clear streams, this naked<br>freshness.<br>These tormices wild arrays, for reasons of their own,<br>I know thee, savage spirit—we have communed to-<br>gether,<br>Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten <br>art?<br>To fuse within themselves its rules precise and deli-<br>catesse?<br>The lyrist's measure'd beat, the wrought out temple's <br>grace—columns and plish'd arch forgot?<br>but thou that revelest here—spirit that form'd this<br>scene,<br>They have remember'd thee.</p><p>In four lines Mr. Whitman catches a thought that embalms philosophy in poetry. It is this:</p><p><em>ROAMING IN THOUGHT.</em></p><p>[After reading Hegel.]<br>Roaming in thought over the Universe, I saw the <br>little that is good steadily hastening towards <br>immortality,<br>And the vast all that is call'd Evil I saw hastening <br>to merge itself and become lost and dead.</p><p>Two other poems of exceptional merit and both new, we quote: The first is:</p><p><em>THE DALLIANCE OF THE EAGLES.</em></p><p>Skirting the river road, (my forenoon walk, my <br>rest,)<br>Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance <br>of the eagles,<br>The rushing amorous contact high in space together,<br>The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, <br>gyrating wheel,<br>Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass <br>tight grappling,<br>In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight down-<br>ward falling,<br>Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a mo-<br>ment's lull,<br>A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, <br>talons loosening,<br>Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their <br>separate diverse flight,<br>She hers, he his, pursuing.</p><p>The second like the one previously quoted is inspired by bird life, and its force is apparent:</p><p><em>TO THE MAN-OF-WAR BIRD.</em></p><p>Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm,<br>Waking renew'd on thy prodigious pinions.<br>(Burst the wild storm? above it thou ascended'st,<br>And rested on the sky, thy slave that cradled thee),<br>Now a blue point, far, far in heaven floating.<br>As to the light emerging here on deck I watch thee,<br>(Myself a speck, a point on the world's floating <br>vast)</p><p>Far, far at sea,<br>After the night's fierce drifts have strewn the shore <br>with wrecks,<br>With reappearing day as now so happy and serene,<br>The rosy and elastic dawn, the flashing sun,<br>The limpid spread of air cerulean,<br>Thou also reappearest.<br>Thou born to match the gale (thou art all wings)<br>To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurri-<br>cane,<br>Thou ship of air that never furl's thy sails,<br>Days, even weeks untired and onward, through <br>spaces, realms gyrating.<br>At dusk that look'st on Senegal, at morn America,<br>That sport'st amid the lightning flash and thunder <br>cloud,<br>In them, in thy experiences, had'st thou my soul,<br>What joys! what joys were thine!</p><p>Mr. Whitman still braves the criticism adverse to certain passages of his poems which has been made. He has expunged none of the lines, except to gain conciseness. That the public is gradually coming to appreciate Walt Whitman and recognize his worth as a poet is evident, and the new edition of his works will be gladly welcomed.</p>",

	"title": "Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass'",
	"body": "<p>Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>PRACTICALLY, but not actually, this is the first time that Mr. Whitman has issued his poems through a publishing house instead of at his private cost. The two volumes called Leaves of Grass and the Two Rivulets, which he had printed and himself sold at Camden, N. J., are now issued in one, under the former title, without special accretions of new work, but not without a good deal of re-arrangement in the sequence of the poems. Pieces that were evidently written later, and intended to be eventually put under Leaves of Grass now find their place; some that apparently did well enough where they were have been shifted to other departments. On the whole, however, the changes have been in the direction of greater clearness as regards their relation to the sub-titles. It is not apparent, however, that the new book is greatly superior to the old in typography, although undeniably the fault of the privately printed volumes, a variation in types used, is no longer met with. The margins are narrower, and the look of the page more commonplace. The famous poem called 'Walt Whitman' is now the 'Song of Myself.' It still maintains:</p><p>I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable;<br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p><p>It still has the portrait of Whitman when younger, standing in a loose flannel shirt and slouched hat, with one hand on his hip, the other in his pocket. 'Eidolons' has been taken from the second volume and placed, for good reasons that the reader may not be ready to understand, among the first pieces gathered under the sub-title 'Inscriptions.' It ends with the 'Songs of Parting,' under which the last is 'So Long,' a title that a foreigner and perhaps many an American might easily consider quite as untranslatable as Mr. Whitman proclaims himself to be. The motive for the publication seems to be to take advantage of that wider popularity which is coming somewhat late in life to him whom his admirers like to call 'the good gray poet.'</p><p>One great anomaly of Whitman's case has been that while he is an aggressive champion of democracy and of the working-man, in a broad sense of the term working-man, his admirers have been almost exclusively of a class the farthest possibly removed from that which labors for daily bread by manual work. Whitman has always been truly caviare to the multitude. It was only those that knew much of poetry and loved it greatly who penetrated the singular shell of his verses and rejoiced in the rich, pulpy kernel. Even with connoisseurs, Whitman has been somewhat of an acquired taste, and it has always been amusing to note the readiness with which persons who would not or could not read him, raised a cry of affectation against those who did. This phenomenon is too well known in other departments of taste to need further remark; but it may be added that Mr. Whitman has both gained by it and lost. He has gained a vigorousness of support on the part of his admirers that probably more than outbalances the acrid attacks of those who consider his work synonymous with all that is vicious in poetical technique, and wicked from the point of morals. As to the latter, it must be confessed that, according to present standards of social relations, the doctrines taught by Whitman might readily be construed, by the overhasty or unscrupulous, into excuses for foul living: for such persons do not look below the surface, nor can they grasp the whole idea of Whitman's treatment of love. However fervid his expressions may be, and however scornful he is of the miserable hypocrisies that fetter but also protect the evilly disposed, it is plain that the idea he has at heart is that universal love which leaves no room for wickedness because it leaves no room for doing or saying unkind, uncharitable, unjust things to his fellow-man. With an exuberance of thought that would supply the mental outfit of ten ordinary poets, and with a rush of words that is by no means reckless, but intensely and grandly labored, Whitman hurls his view of the world at the heads of his readers with a vigor and boldness that takes away one's breath.</p><p>This century is getting noted among centuries for singular departures in art and literature. Among them all, there is none bolder or more original than that of Whitman. Perhaps Poe in his own line might be cited as an equal. It is strange, and yet it is not strange, that he should have waited so long for recognition, and that by many thousands of people of no little culture his claims to being a poet at all are either frankly scouted or else held in abeyance. Literature here has remarkably held aloof from the vital thoughts and hopes of the country. It seems as if the very crudity of the struggle here drove people into a petty dilettante atmosphere of prettiness in art and literature as an escape from the dust and cinders of daily life. Hence our national love for 'slicked up' pictures, for instance, by which it is often claimed in Europe that promising geniuses in painting, there, have been ruined for higher work. Hence our patronage of poets that have all the polish of a cymbal, but all a cymbal's dry note and hollowness. Hence, at one time, our admiration for orators that were ornate to the verge of inanity. Into this hot-house air of literature Walt Whitman bounded, with the vigor and suppleness of a clown at a funeral. Dire were the grimaces of the mourners in high places, and dire are their grimaces still.</p><p>There were plenty of criticisms to make, even after one had finished crying Oh! at the frank sensuality, the unbelievable nakedness of Walt. Everything that decent folk covered up, Walt exhibited, and boasted of exhibiting! He was proud of his nakedness and sensuality. He cried, Look here, you pampered rogues of literature, what are you squirming about, when you know, and everybody knows, that things are just like this, always have been, always will be? But it must be remembered that this was what he wrote, and that he did with a plan, and by order from his genius. It has never been heard of him that he was disgusting in talk or vile in private life, while it has been known that poets celebrated for the lofty tone of their morality, for the strictness of their Christianity, the purity of their cabinet hymns, can condescend in private life to wallow in all that is base. That is the other great anomaly of Whitman. He rhapsodizes of things seldom seen in print with the enthusiasm of a surgeon enamoured of the wonderful mechanism of the body. But he does not soil his conversation with lewdness. If evil is in him, it is in his book.</p><p>Whitman's strength and Whitman's weakness lie in his lack of taste. As a mere external sign, look at his privately printed volumes. For a printer and typesetter, reporter and editor, they do not show taste in the selection and arrangement of the type. A cardinal sin in the eyes of most critics is the use of French, Spanish, and American-Spanish words which are scattered here and there, as if Whitman had picked them up, sometimes slightly incorrectly, from wandering minstrels, Cubans, or fugitives from one of Walker's raids. He shows crudely the American way of incorporating into the language a handy or a high-sounding word without elaborate examination of its original meaning, just as we absorb the different nationalities that crowd over from Europe. His thought and his mode of expression is immense, often flat, very often monotonous, like our great sprawling cities with their endless scattering of suburbs. Yet when one gets the 'hang' of it, there is a colossal grandeur in conception and execution that must finally convince whoever will be patient enough to look for it. His rhythm, so much burlesqued, is all of a part with the man and his ideas. It is apparently confused; really most carefully schemed; certainly to a high degree original. It has what to the present writer is the finest thing in the music of Wagner - a great booming movement or undertone, like the noise of heavy surf. His crowded adjectives are like the medival writers of Irish, those extraordinary poets who sang the old Irish heroes and their own contemporaries, the chiefs of their clans. No Irishman of to-day has written a nobler lament for Ireland, or a more hopeful, or a more truthful, than has Walt Whitman. Yet it is not said that he has Irish blood. Nor is there to be found in our literature another original piece of prose so valuable to future historians as his notes on the war. Nor is there a poet of the war-time extant who has so struck the note of that day of conflict as Whitman has in 'Drum Taps.' He makes the flesh creep. His verses are like the march of the long lines of volunteers, and then again like the bugles of distant cavalry. But these are parts of him. As he stands complete in Leaves of Grass, in spite of all the things that regard for the decencies of drawing-rooms and families may wish away, he certainly represents, as no other writer in the world, the struggling, blundering, sound-hearted, somewhat coarse, but still magnificent vanguard of Western civilization that is encamped in the United States of America. He avoids the cultured few. He wants to represent, and does in his own strange way represent, the lower middle stratum of humanity. But, so far, it is not evident that his chosen constituency cares for, or has even recognized him. Wide readers are beginning to guess his proportions.</p><p>———</p><p>Leaves of Grass By Walt Whitman. Boston: James R. Osgood & Co.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman's New Book",
	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman's New Book.</p><p>From Our Special Correspondent.</p><p>BOSTON, Tuesday, November 8.</p><p>. . .</p><p>It was a great age, men will say hereafter, and a grand country that could produce in one generation three figures for posterity to gaze on like John Brown, Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman,—men unlike each other and unlike all others, such as no other land produced or could produce; embodied heroism, embodied sense and sensibility, embodied imagination. So I view the three men, in the mass of their character,—not considering the loose and trivial details which to many eyes have seemed to be the whole character. It if were possible to see the genius of a great people throwing itself now into this form, now into that,—as the prairie wheat-field takes the quick shape of the passing wind-it would be just to say that we had seen this mystery in the 'plain heroic magnitude of mind' with which [John] Brown met death,—in the broad and patient wisdom of Lincoln,—and in the immense landscape of Whitman's teeming and unharvested imagination. His 'Leaves of Grass,' as he has now published them at Osgood's in Boston, complete the vast picture of his mind and bring out not merely the confusion of details, which we could only see at first, by the light of poetic flashes—but the broad unity of the piece. It is as if the ancient seamen had found their ocean-god slumbering along his shores, and upon near view could only see a hand here, an eyebrow there, a floating mass of beard elsewhere,—but when they stood back from the strand, or best if they climbed a hill of prospect, the symmetry and articulation of the mighty frame plainly appeared, and they knew by sight their unconscious divinity, Neptune. There is in Whitman's verse, more than in any other modern poet's, what Keats called 'that large utterance of the early gods,'-an indistinct grandeur of expression not yet molded to the melody of Shakespeare, Lucretius and Æschylus, but like what Keats again calls 'the overwhelming voice of huge Enceladus':—</p><p>'Whose ponderous syllables, like sullen waves<br>In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rock<br>Came booming thus,'—</p><p>'I announce natural persons to arise,<br>I announce justice triumphant,<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,<br>I announce the justification of candor and the justifi- <br>cation of pride.<br>I announce that the identity of those states is a sin-<br> gle identity only,<br>I announce the Union more and more compact, indis-<br> soluble,<br>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the <br>previous polities of the earth insignificant.'</p><p>It is when he speaks of Lincoln and the civil war that Whitman is least indistinct, and no other of our poets-no nor all of them together-has so well caught and rendered the spirit of that struggle as he has done it. As has been remarked by others no doubt, and more than once, Whitman gives the whole episode of slavery in its relation to the war, in the strange fragment called</p><p><em>ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLORS.</em></p><p>Who are you, dusky woman, so ancient, hardly human,With your woolly-white and turbaned head, and bare bony feet?Why, rising by the roadside here, do you the colors greet?</p><p>'Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,<br>Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to <br>me,<br>As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.</p><p><em>Me, master, years a hundred since from my parents <br>sundered.<br>A little child they caught me as the savage beast <br>is caught,<br>Then hither me across the sea, the cruel slaver <br>brought.</em></p><p>No further does she say, but lingering all day,<br>Her high borne turbaned head she wags, and rolls <br>her darkling eye,<br>And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving <br>by.</p><p>What is it, fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?<br>Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red <br>and green?<br>Are the things so strange and marvelous you see or <br>have seen?</p><p>This new volume of Whitman's contains philosophy, antiquities and history all in one, and is the book of the year in Boston which will bear the most reading and study. The only one to compare with it is another of Osgood's publications, Mr Cooke's 'Ralph Waldo Emerson,'-and the two are curiously related to each other. But for Emerson, Whitman might never have written, or written in another form, and what can be further from the Emersonian mode of writing than these unformed and almost lawless numbers, this broad range over the most prosaic elements of life, as well as those regions of ideal beauty in which the genius of Emerson delights?</p>",

	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman's New Book.</p><p>A good many folks in middle Long Island, especially Huntington, West Hills (where Walt Whitman was born), Cold Spring and down at Babylon, where he lived as boy and young man, will no doubt take special interest in the fact that the new book of his completed poems, 'Leaves of Grass' has just been published by James R. Osgood & Co. of Boston, in a handsome 382 page volume, price $2. There are about three hundred pieces all composed in the free and capricious measure so peculiar to Whitman (entirely unlike poetry as generally written), and which few people will like at first sight, whatever they may do after studying it well out.</p><p>Mr. Whitman was here in Huntington last summer and it is said intends coming again next season. He is crippled from paralysis, is now in his 63d year; he still writes, lectures, gives readings from his works and travels moderately. The Boston Herald says of his poems: </p><p>'One of the great features of Walt Whitman is that he does not seek his ideals in faraway times, which, stripped of their glamor of remoteness, are but as the times of to-day; for in supreme moments, he idealizes the common-place, and has the clearness of vision that discerns the gleam of gold through all the accumulated dross.</p><p>The large and magnificent tolerance that includes all and allows all, and finds a place for all, is a sublime characteristic of the man. There is much in these lines that cannot be packed into layers of equal length. The book teems with the ecstacy of being. The statement of details into which the poet now and then drops has been criticised as 'cataloguing.' But viewed with the poet’s intention, what a mosaic picture of the people, of the nation and its races, is thus constituted! One sees the stir and hears the hum of the entire land; feels the pulse of the multitude. What is the use of attempting to depict such a thing—it can't all be shown. But the effect is like a gleam of sunshine in the depths of a forest; it reveals many things with vivid distinctness; there is a vast reserve of hidden things which might be seen, but enough is shown to tell what is there—to give the character of the place.</p><p>The new edition contains all his poems; the only changes that have been made are in the way of condensation of utterance. There are, also, something like 20 new poems printed direct from the manuscript. There is more of a rounding and completeness of the work; the all-embracing patriotism which forms one of the poet’s grandest characteristic is more comprehensive than ever before manifested.'</p><p><em>FROM WALT WHITMAN'S NEW BOOK. </em><br><p><em>PATROLING BARNEGAT.</em></p><p>Wild, wild the storm, and the sea high running,<br>Steady the roar of the gale, with incessant under-tone muttering,<br>Shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing,<br>Waves, air, midnight, their savagest trinity lashing,<br>Out in the shadows there, milk-white combs careering,<br>On beachy slush and sand, spirts of snow fierce slanting,<br>Where, through the murk, the easterly death-wind breasting,<br>Through cutting swirl and spray, watchful and firm advancing,<br>(That in the distance! is that a wreck? is the red signal flaring?)<br>Slush and sand of the beach, tireless till daylight wending,<br>Steadily, slowly, through hoarse roar never remitting,<br>Along the midnight edge, by those milk-white combs careering,<br>A group of dim, weird forms, struggling, the night confronting,<br>That savage trinity warily watching.</p>",

	"body": "<p>'LEAVES OF GRASS.' </p><p>———</p><p>Kosmos, or Walt Whitman's Song of the Universe. </p><p>———</p><p>A Perfect Poem-Picture of American Democracy. </p><p>———</p><p>The Hermit Thoreau's Opinion of Our Good Gray Poet. </p><p>———</p><p>Should any one ask the question, 'Will Walt Whitman, the poet, and 'Leaves of Grass' (the work on which his fame will rest, whatever he may write in the future), now that after upward of twenty-five years of patient waiting both have got within the sacred circle controlled by a syndicate of literary men and publishers, become rapidly popular?' The answer must be, 'No.' The book is too radical, too free, too independent and far too true to make its conquest of a popular verdict an easy matter. To the question, 'Will the book and the man ever be popular?' the answer, in the opinion of the present writer, must be a qualified 'Yes.' Walt Whitman is, par excellence, the poet and priest of democracy—the American type of democracy; the democracy based upon individuality, though not, perhaps, the ultimate democracy; the democracy based upon I, the individual; not the democracy based upon we, the sum of all individuals. In 'Leaves of Grass' Walt Whitman has personified—or rather, idealized—the genius of American democracy. The work cannot be separated into any number of complete and independent poems: it is one complete and all-embracing poem, the subject of which is the Kosmos. It is the Kosmos as viewed from the standpoint of the American idea of democracy—the sovereignty of each and every individual. Walt Whitman is an individualist of the most pronounced type. So, while admitting that his grand psalms of the Universe will attain a gradual and limited popularity, attaining such popularity only as fast as they become popularly understood, their influence may diminish should ever the American idea of democracy—individual sovereignty—lose its hold on popular opinion.</p><p>Walt Whitman has written the drama—it may be almost called the history—of the first century of American civilization. It may be doubted whether it will fit the second century as well; indeed, how could that be expected, for is it possible to write</p><p><strong>The Drama of the Future!</strong></p><p>All that we can know of the future we have learned from the past and from what we can understand of the tendencies of this present time; but what poet or seer, let him be ever so wise, can forecast the future development—even for one brief century—of the wonderful, creative, multitudinous human mind? But let us take a survey of the book. Let us see how far it fits the foregoing remarks. First, as to the title—why 'Leaves of Grass?' The author himself evidently loves the title, as is evinced by the ornamentation not only of the latest but of previous editions. His very signature on the cover reminds one of grass—and it has a meaning. Let us read the opening in his own words:</p><p>'A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with <br>full hands;<br>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it <br>is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of <br>hopeful green-stuff woven.<br>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord.<br>A scented gift and rememberance designedly dropt.<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, <br>that we may see and remark, and say whose?</p><p>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced <br>babe of the vegetation.</p><p>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike is broad zones and <br>narrow zones.<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I gave them <br>the same, I receive the same.</p><p>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of <br>graves.<br>. . . . . . . . <br>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death.<br>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not <br>wait at the end to arrest it,<br>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.</p><p>All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,<br>And to die is different from what any one supposed, <br>and luckier.'</p><p>'Leaves of Grass,' then, are not only symbolical of all the great alchemy of nature, of all creation, all production, all evolution, but symbolical of immortality as well—the permanence and indestructability of all things. And so the title is good.</p><p>What of the man? What of Walt Whitman himself? This brings us to one of the most interesting features of the book; indeed, the key to its entire plan-its marked personality. It was not by mere whim or caprice—much less by accident or any publisher's device—that the unique portrait of the author (the only illustration of the volume) is not in the usual place, fronting the title-page, but incorporated in the verse, and accompanied by his account of his own relation to his work and to the reader. This is introduced as a</p><p><strong>Song of Myself.</strong></p><p>and is carried through fifty-two stanzas, occupying fifty pages. The portrait, copied from a daguerreotype taken in 1856, when he was a working carpenter, as well as an unhatched poet—represents him in the loose shirt, open at the neck and lapping over the waist of the unbraced pants of an ordinary mechanic; his flannel undershirt revealed; a broad-brimmed, soft felt hat carelessly thrown back sideways on his head, which is inclined in the same way. The expression on his face shows energy, self-reliance and is full of thought; his attitude is firm, careless and unstudied-the left hand in his pocket and the right resting with bent elbows on his hip, which is thrown up to support it. There he stands—Walt Whitman—a man and a workingman; every line, every shadow, 'every atom of blood' and fibre of him. But let him speak for himself:</p><p>'I celebrate myself, and sing myself.<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to <br>you.</p><p>I loafe and invite my soul.<br>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of sum-<br>mer grass.</p><p>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this <br>soil, this air,<br>Born here of parents born here from parents the <br>Same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begins,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.<br>. . . . . . . . <br>Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess <br>the origin of all poems,<br>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun (there <br>are millions of suns left,)<br>You shall no longer take things at second or third <br>hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor <br>feed on the spectres of books,<br>You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take <br>things from me,<br>You shall listen to all sides and filter them for yourself.</p><p>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk <br>of the beginning and the end,<br>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.</p><p>There was never any more inception than there is <br>now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is <br>now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.</p><p>Urge and urge and urge,<br>Always the procreant urge of the world.</p><p>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always <br>substance and increase, always sex,<br>Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always <br>a breed of life.</p><p>To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel <br>that it is so.</p><p>Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, <br>well entretied, braced in the beams,<br>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,<br>I and this mystery here we stand.<br>. . . . . . . . <br>Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I <br>am.<br>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, <br>unitary,<br>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm or an impalpa-<br>ble certain rest.<br>Looking with side-curved head curious what will <br>come next,<br>Both in and out of the game and watching and won-<br>dering at it.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your <br>throat,<br>Not words, music or rhyme I want, nor custom or <br>lecture, not even the best.<br>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my <br>own.<br>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my <br>own.<br>And that all the men ever 'born are also my brothers, <br>and the women my sisters and lovers,<br>And that a kelson of the creator is love,<br>And limitless are leaves, stiff and drooping in the <br>fields.<br>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,<br>And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, <br>elder, mullein and poke-weed.'</p><p>'A child said, What is the grass?' etc., then comes in, and for several pages the reader's attention is chained to </p><p><strong>A Beautiful Panorama of Human Life</strong></p><p>in all its various aspects, civilized and uncivilized; to all possible life experiences of men, women and children; life animate and inanimate (if the term is admissible), all of which, and all actions and feelings and promptings and meanings, are embodied in himself, and felt and expressed by himself—Walt Whitman. We can only cull a specimen or two here and there as we turn over the charming pages:</p><p>'The little one sleeps in its cradle,<br>I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently <br>brush away flies with my hand.</p><p>I am enamor'd of growing out-doors,<br>Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or <br>woods,<br>Of the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders <br>of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,<br>I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.</p><p>What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest is Me.</p><p>Me coming in for my chances, spending for vast <br>returns,<br>Adoring myself to bestow myself on the first that <br>will take me,<br>Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,<br>Scattering it freely for ever.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.</p><p>I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the <br>wise,<br>Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br>Material as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<br>Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with <br>the stuff that is fine,<br>One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the <br>same and the largest the same.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thought-<br>fullest,<br>A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seas-<br>ons.<br>Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and re-<br>ligion,<br>A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, Quaker,<br>Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.</p><p>I resist anything better than my own diversity,<br>Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,<br>And am not stuck up, and am in my place.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>These are really the thoughts of all men, in all ages <br>and lands, they are not original with me,<br>If they are not yours as much as mine they are noth-<br>ing, or next to nothing,<br>If they are not just as close as they are distant they <br>are nothing.</p><p>This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and <br>the water is,<br>This the common air that bathes the globe.'</p><p>Now comes a passage remarkable for its nobility:</p><p>'With music strong I come, with my cornets and my <br>drums,<br>I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play <br>Marches for conquer'd and slain persons.<br>Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>I also say it is good to fail, battles are lost in the same <br>spirit in which they are won.<br>I beat and pound for the dead,<br>I blow through my embouchures my loudest and <br>gayest for them.</p><p>Vivas to those who have fail'd!<br>And to those whose war vessels sang in the sea!<br>And to those themselves who sank in the sea!<br>And to all generals that lost engagements, and all <br>overcome heroes!<br>And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the <br>greatest heroes known!<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>In all people I see myself, none more and not one <br>barley-corn less,<br>And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>I exist as I am, that is enough,<br>If no other in the world be aware I sit content,<br>And if each and all be aware I sit content.</p><p>My foot-hold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution,<br>And I know the amplitude of time.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br>And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,<br>And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of <br>men.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline <br>to be the poet of wickedness also.<br>What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?<br>Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand <br>indifferent.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>Endless unfolding of words of ages!<br>And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.</p><p>A word of the faith that never balks,<br>Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I ac-<br>cept Time absolutely.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>I accept reality and dare not question it,<br>Materialism first and last imbuing.</p><p>Now for the key-note of</p><p><strong>Our Author's Cosmopolitan Personality:</strong></p><p>'Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and <br>breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women, <br>or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>Unscrew the doors themselves from the jambs!</p><p>Whoever degrades another degrades me,<br>And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>I speak the password primeval, I give the sign of <br>Democracy.<br>By God!

quoted serve to give some idea of the spirit and meaning of this wonderful poem of humanity and the universe? It has been written with the hope that it may, but with no expectation of doing anything like justice to the vast range of observation, profundity and minuteness of analysis, philosophic and religious interpretation, intimate knowledge and deep and earnest sympathy, not only with all humanity but with all nature, that</p><p><strong>Place this Book in the Front Rank</strong></p><p>of the highest branches of American literature. One might as well try to epitomize Shakespeare in a newspaper article as to try to do so with 'Leaves of Grass.' That all who read this imperfect review will be induced thereby to read and study the volume for themselves, and become greater, nobler and happier by the experience, is the earnest hope of the writer.</p><p>The following appreciative opinion of, that other faithful student of nature—Thoreau—written in 1856, and therefore at a time when even a man of his independence could hardly be expected to be very outspoken in the face of social prudery, will be read with interest, and will be a fitting appendix to what has been already said:</p><p>'He (Whitman) is apparently the greatest democrat the world has seen; a remarkably strong, though coarse nature, of a sweet disposition, and much prized by his friends. Though peculiar and rough in his exterior, his skin, all over, red, he is essentially a gentleman. I am still in some quandary about him—feel that he is essentially strange to me, at any rate; but am surprised by the sight of him. He is very broad, but not fine . . . . He has long been an editor and writer for the newspapers—was editor for the N.O. Crescent once . . . . Since I have seen him, I am not disturbed by any brag or egoism in his book. He is a great fellow. There are two or three pieces in the book which are disagreeable, at least, simply sensual. He does not celebrate love at all. It is as if the beasts spoke. I think men have not been ashamed of themselves without reason. No doubt there have always been dens where such deeds were unblushingly recited, and it is no merit to compete with such. But even on this side he has spoken more truth than any modern I know. [What of Shakespeare, Byron and Burns?] I have found his poem exhilarating, encouraging. [Emerson uses a similar expression.] As for its sensuality—and it may be less so than it seems—I do not so much wish those parts unwritten, as that men were so pure that they could read them without harm, that is without understanding them (?) . . . . On the whole it is to me very brave and American. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He occasionally suggests something a little more than human. How people must shudder as they read him? He is awfully good. To be sure I sometimes feel a little imposed on. By his heartiness and broad generalities he puts me into a liberal frame of mind prepared to see wonders—as it were sets me upon a hill or in the midst of a plain—stirs me well up and then—throws in a thousand of brick. Though rude and sometimes ineffectual, it is a good primitive poem—an alarum or trumpet-note ringing through the American camp. Wonderfully like the Orientals, too, considering that when I asked if he had read them he answered, 'No; tell me about them.''</p><p>Thoreau has evidently written just what he felt when the surprise and what may be called the shock of an unprecedented revelation was fresh upon him. His candor and his good judgment, under the circumstances, is worthy of all commendation, but he might write differently today were he alive.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman, a Kosmos. </p><p>To make a mark on the sands of life in this busiest, windiest and most tidal period of the world's history, and to keep that mark fresh and deepening for seven-and-twenty years, is no little achievement for an American author. This Whitman has done, and something more than this. When in 1855 he printed with his own hands his odd and sprawling lines of his 'Leaves of Grass' (a few copies, long since out of print, though hardly any one bought them), he announced himself to the world as a poet, and he has never since taken down his sign. He still carries on business at the own stand; still 'sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' But now instead of six readers he has six thousand, or perhaps six hundred thousand and the back countries have not all been heard from yet. That they understand him we would not guarantee—he does not understand himself always; still less did he understand himself when he began to write. He put to sea on a raft and his only compass was a looking-glass, but he has made as good a voyage on the whole as if he had sailed in the Great Eastern with all the compasses and chronometers and astronomers on board.</p><p>'Were it the will of heaven an osier bough<br>Were vessel strong enough the seas to plow.'</p><p>So said Pindar, only more shortly,—and Whitman has verified the oracle. Courage and trust are the best outfit for a poet, it seems; they are worth all the colleges and libraries in the world. The world itself is the poet's library, and Whitman has had a card to that collection; he has even attempted a catalogue; but like all library catalogues it grows beyond his power to list and index. </p><p>There is a lawless saying, fit only for the wise, but full of meaning for poets and great captains,—</p><p>'Oft have I heard, and deem the witness true,<br>Whom man delights in, God delights in too.'</p><p>But the career of pleasure and admiration which is only possible to power soon finds its limits in human experience, and must be corrected by the sharp lessons of sorrow and mortification,—must be continued, if at all, by the completest self-renunciation and trust in the unseen powers. This discipline Whitman has had, it would seem, and has profited by it. His later poems are not quite in the key of his earlier; they have a more serious and religious tone; and their light is thrown back on the dangerous utterances of his youth. He has not rejected these utterances,—has indeed preserved most of them in this new volume,-but has softened them, changed their connection and brought them into a better accord with a life of service to mankind, such as the poet's must be if he would live beyond his own age. Consequently this book will be received, we fancy, as none of Whitman's former books have been. It will no longer be a work prohibited, but, in spite of many passages which must always keep it from a familiar place on the table, and from the perfect liberty of unformed judgments,—it will find its way into all good libraries and into many homes. For the civil war made Whitman a domestic poet, which he had hardly been before. The clear recognition and pathetic portrayal of the home affection in the Americans, not less than their patriotism and devotion to democracy, gives 'Drum Taps' an affectionate place in the hearts of his readers. The philosophy of 'Leaves of Grass' was oriental,—grand, but peculiar, and to the multitude either irreligious or suspicious,—but this was changed in the war-poems into a spirit which the multitude could understand, because they shared it,—which, indeed, was born of the multitude and possessed Whitman as one of the many, not as among the few. Another change noticeable in him at that time and since affected his meter and the melody of his verse. The measure of the old chapters in 'Leaves of Grass' can hardly be called a meter at all: what rhythm it had was rather like the rhythm of Hebrew poetry, in the antithesis or repetition of ideas, not in the harmonious arrangement of words. But it would seem as if the music of the regiments:—</p><p>'Sonorous metal blowing martial sound,'</p><p>had suggested to Whitman a new movement for his lines.3 They soon became measured and choral in their character,—not a set measure, like the tweedle-de-dum, tweedle-de-dee of the mediocre poets, but a dithyrambic orchestral movement, responding to chords struck at irregular intervals, and leaving the mind free to catch up the next strain, wherever it might come in. This in part is the secret of the Greek chorus-poetry, to which (though the Greek measures are more balanced and mutually responsive) the war pieces of Whitman, and much of his later poetry, bears a strong resemblance. The book deserves study even as a metrical anomaly, were it not entitled to consideration upon much higher regards.</p><p>Lofty as any sound estimate of Whitman's book must be, it has faults enough to have long ago destroyed the reputation of any writer who had not something better than singularity to commend him. Concerning these, as well as for a larger consideration of his work and place, we shall take another time to speak. Here we say only that the book is a noble one, and must be so adjudged before any proper discount upon its merits can be made.</p>",

Malleck and Oscar Wilde, we are presented with the slop-bucket of Walt Whitman. The celebrity of this phenomenal poet bears a curious disproportion to the circulation of his writings. Until now, it cannot be said that his verses have ever been published at all. They have been printed irregularly and read behind the door. They have been vaunted extravagantly by a band of extravagant disciples; and the possessors of the books have kept them locked up from the family. Some have valued them for the 'barbaric yawp,' which seems to them the note of a new, vigorous, democratic, American school of literature; some for the fragments of real poetry floating in the turbid mass; some for the nastiness and animal insensibility to shame which entitle a great many of the poems to a dubious reputation as curiosities. Now that they are thrust into our faces at the book stalls there must be a reexamination of the myth of the Good Gray Poet. It seems to me that there is no need at this late day to consider Mr. Whitman's claims to the immortality of genius. That he is a poet most of us frankly admit. His merits have been set forth many times, and at great length, and if the world has erred materially in its judgment of them the error has been a lazy and unquestioning acquiescence in some of the extreme demands of his vociferous partisans. The chief question raised by this publication is whether anybody—even a poet—ought to take off his trousers in the market place. Of late years we believe that Mr. Whitman has not chosen to be so shocking as he was when he had his notoriety to make, and many of his admirers—the rational ones—hoped that the 'Leaves of Grass' would be weeded out before he set them out again. But this has not been done; and indeed Mr. Whitman could hardly do it without falsifying the first principle of his philosophy, which is a belief in his own perfection, and the second principle, which is a belief in the preciousness of filth. 'Divine am I,' he cries. 'Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touched from. The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer. This head more than churches, Bibles and all the creeds.' He knows that he is 'august.' He does not care for anybody's opinion. He is </p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos of Manhattan the son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no slander above men and women or apart from them.<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>There is nothing in the universe better than Walt Whitman. That is the burden of the 'Song of Myself' which fills fifty pages of the present volume: </p><p>I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious.</p><p>Nothing is obscene or indecent to him. It is his mission to shout the forbidden voices, to tear the veil off everything, to clarify and transfigure all that is dirty and vile, to proclaim that garbage is just as good as nectar if you are only lusty enough to think so. His immodesty is free from glamour of every sort. Neither amatory sentiment nor susceptibility to physical beauty appears to have anything to do with it. It is entirely bestial; and in this respect we know of nothing in literature which can be compared with it. Walt Whitman, despising what he calls conventionalism, and vaunting the athletic democracy, asks to be accepted as the master of a new poetical school, fresh, free, stalwart, 'immense in passion, pulse and power,' the embodiment of the spirit of vigorous America. But the gross materialism of his verses represents art in its last degradation rather than its rude infancy.</p>",

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS.</p><p>THIS is the collected and revised poetry of Walt Whitman, who, some will have it, is by preeminence of art and nature our representative American poet. It will be noticed that at last he has found a publisher other than himself. What this nation may become it might not be wise to prophesy; but we may at the start humbly entertain the hope, at least, that at this present writing our nationality, in root and fiber, is something else than what Mr. Whitman sings. His book is one of courage, most downright in its dogmatics, and says its say apparently without the slightest consideration for the fact that much it says must cross and shock the deepest ethical instincts of a great multitude—we should certainly hope the vast majority of those American men and women who by any misfortune are led to read him. For these poems are of that breed that they force the honest critic into a corner where he must either speak plain words, or step down and out from his judgment-seat. This is a book which makes not only war upon nearly all traditional theories of true poetry, but in many places a very brutal assault upon our fixed ideas of human decency and purity. For instance, it has long been held that poetry is not merely the prose of any philosophy, history, geography, anthropology, or, we might add, anatomy or sexual physiology; but must have some sort of inherent rhythm and melody—the heartbeats and spiritual pulsations of the poet. This, for want of a better term, we call the form of poetry. Tennyson, for example, is a master of poetic form. The poems under review, as to form, run to a chaos of monotonies. It is not the chaotic diversity of the wild woods, or the sea waves, or the autumn leaves, or the sand grains in a gravel-pit, in all which there is the articulated beauty and inbred virtue of nature obedient to the Great Craftsman. The chaos of Mr. Whitman's verse, to compare great with small, reminds us of the gray clay bluffs of Truro Beach. Would it were as clean! In form he reminds us of Martin Farquhar Tupper.</p><p>There is vastly more to be said as to his substance. First of all, and gladly, this: that he has, in his nigh four hundred pages, spurts and flashes of some things which say: 'This could and should have been a noble creature.' He has a quick, sharp sight for the surfaces of natural scenery, as when he speaks of the 'heart-shaped' leaf of the lilac; but somehow he seems incapable of grasping the inner spiritual lessons of field and flood, or a spiritual analogy. The best instance of the opposite we have found on a careful search is this:</p><p>I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of <br>the stars (p. 53).</p><p>His grasp of the detail of an event, but not of its ethical quality, is shown in his description of a sea-fight [pp. 62-63]. Somehow he never shows us the soul of anything. We may ask even, 'Does he believe there is any such thing as a soul?' American he is, of the ruder and more barbaric type, a prairie cow boy in a buffalo robe, with a voice of the east wind, shouting prophecies and incantations about what he thinks he sees and knows. But from civilized speech or melody he seems strangely remote. Egotism, if a virtue, is certainly an unfragrant one, and Walt Whitman's egotism, grotesque as it is, is perhaps less grotesque than gigantic. He describes himself well enough in the lines,</p><p>I am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable— <br>I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p> <p>Mr. Whitman's religion is no doubt to him a serious matter, and it is a somewhat serious matter to discover what in the world it is. He often discourses eloquently of God, as when (p. 76) he says:</p><p>I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is <br>signed by God's name,<br>And I leave them where they are for I know that whereso-<br>ever I go<br>Others will punctually come forever and ever.</p><p>Yet the prevalent tone of his verses is curiously Asiatic, as though he were an incarnation of Brahma, and a pantheist. He says (p. 31):</p><p>Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that <br>is not my soul.</p><p>(A cess-pool, for instance).</p><p>In fact, he declares himself to be all that the universe is, even to being at the same moment each of two exactly opposite things, as though a man at any given instant were and were not. Indeed, it is this rapt but noisy mysticism which makes it rather hard to finger Mr. Whitman and touch his quality. Not that true poetry does not allow mysticism, or that mystics are not often poets. Indeed, high poetry is often a blessed hint, and only a hint, of a vaster world within the veil of the unreachable and the non- measurable.</p><p>Uhland's ballad, 'The Two Locks of Hair,' for instance, hints at the draped and veiled world of sorrow, whose mysteries are only revealed to the mourners after here. Mr. Whitman's mysticism is a fog-bank that cloaks all, even the possible hint itself. Add to this his all-pervading oracularity of speech, and he is certainly a man hard to be 'understanded' of common folk. And yet there are gleams in his book, not only of great things, but of possibly magnificent ones. His tribute to Abraham Lincoln (p. 262), beginning 'O Captain! my Captain!' is a weird and rare performance. 'The Singer in the Prison' (p. 292) beginning</p><p>O sight of pity, shame and dole <br>O fearful thought—a convict soul,</p><p>is full of tenderness and pathos.</p><p>The ethical quality of Mr. Whitman's poems remains to be examined. Here, in all honesty, it is hard to know what to say or what to leave unsaid. Gray hairs have their rights, and ought to be a shield against taunt and bitterness; but woman's purity and human society have their rights also, and there are little children growing up into the arena of the world's toil and trial who have their rights as well. We go now upon the assumption that there are certain elements of decency which pervade all human society, heathen and otherwise, and that the world is not too old to blush. We say that there are passages in this book that never ought to have been written, much less published; passages which sound like a lecture on the obstetrics of lust and (may we say it with all deference to our well-bred readers) the apotheosis of the Phallus. It is hard to overstate this matter. When a man with such physical imagery of shame sum- mons the very wind (p. 49) to be assistant in a poetical concubinage as realistic as a French invisible card, and the salt sea also (p. 46), it is certainly time for us common mortals who have still some respect for the seventh commandment to stay in doors from the elements, or, if at sea, to make all speed for the shore. The offense in this wise is not all-pervading, but it is very acute and deep.</p><p>His apologists will say of him that he is only another Adam in the Garden, naked and not ashamed. We say of him, and of all who have assisted in the making of his book, that they are guilty of an act of indecent exposure. For the rest, what Mr. Whitman might have been in poetry we have tried to fairly state. We can only add that if in these Leaves of Grass he has shown himself to be a poet, then the great and shining ones whom the English-speaking race have been wont to honor with this high title, are not.</p><p><em>Leaves of Grass James R. Osgood & Co. </em></p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman and the Poetry of the Future",
	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman and the Poetry of the Future. </p><p>The publication of the Leaves of Grass by a reputable bookmaking house, as a business enterprise, and without expurgation, marks very distinctly an epoch in WALT WHITMAN's career. It was inevitable that the force of his genius should carry, sooner or later, the inner citadel of respectable literature; but the event has been delayed for a quarter of a century. During that time he has been his own printer and bookseller. Containing passages which under a strict construction of certain statutes of the United States could not be permitted to pass through the mails, the privately printed volumes have found a constantly increasing number of purchasers and readers. The accessions have not been from the ranks of the depraved and prurient. Walt Whitman's audience has grown, not by reason of, but in spite of, his frank disregard of some of the proprieties of utterance. Of this side of the matter it is enough to say that if the new edition is a triumph for the poet, it has been achieved without any concession on his part. He has modified nothing. He has cancelled no objectionable line or offensive phrase. He has confessed no sin against good taste or decency. In pushing his way into his present company he has not for an instant hauled in his elbows.</p><p>In another respect the appearance of the new edition of 'Leaves of Grass' is an interesting event. For the first time, the poet can be judged by his poetic scheme in its entirety. The additional verses are not so important in themselves as in the relation of parts to a completed whole. Walt Whitman's admirers have always insisted that criticism before the final development of the plan was premature. The poet has compared his work to one of those ambitious old architectural edifices, built part by part at long intervals, and showing the designer's idea only when the last stone was in place. The gaps have now all been filled. The revision of the several poems, and their rearrangement with reference to the sub-titles and to each other, leave them, we are told, as they were designed to be.</p><p>While Walt Whitman has kept steadily on his way, unshaken in belief in his mission and uncompromising as to his methods, he has provoked a difference of public opinion more marked, perhaps, than in the case of any author now alive. His aggressiveness seems to leave no middle ground. He is either a genius of colossal proportions or an immense windbag; either to be hailed and worshipped or to be punctured. A considerable part of his contemporaries hold him to be beneath criticism; a small circle of ardent admirers exalt him above it. The poet himself, it is to be feared, is prone to encourage the latter view. Every page that he has written discloses an egotism that reaches the verge of sublimity. He is impatient even of discriminating eulogy. He is said to hold as no better than a vender of scurrilities a friend of his, himself a poet, who not long ago published a magazine article in which the laudation of 'Leaves of Grass' was measured instead of being unreserved. With Walt it is: Take me or leave me; but if you take me, take me as the Consummate Man. In estimating a singer and seer this indomitable self-confidence is a quality that ought not to be overlooked. To refuse to admit it as corroborative proof of genius would be to reject one of the lessons of biography. Walt's vigorous personality and the purity and na‹ve simplicity of his private life have drawn about him a circle of devoted friends. They cannot understand why his genius should be denied or overlooked any more than they can see how the existence of the sun can be denied or overlooked when it is shining in a clear sky at noonday. They are exasperated because the great public is so slow to accept the poet at their valuation and his own. On the other hand, those to whom Whitman is a noisy madman, or a disturber of the poetic peace, or a bawler of platitudes, are reluctant to give the poet's adherents credit for any better motive than the affectation of eccentricity. The 'good gray poet' business disgusts them. They are puzzled by the admiration with which Whitman's achievements are regarded by Emerson and Tennyson and other bards who are as unlike the Bard of Paumanok as so many gentlemen in evening dress are unlike a gentleman in a diving suit. And all the while the belief is growing in cultivated minds that in Walt Whitman we have one of the most remarkable and original individualities in literature.</p><p>Let us look first at his method. It is from the superficial and non-essential characteristics of 'Leaves of Grass' that the popular conception of the poet is derived. The oddities, the whim-whams, the grotesque contrasts lie on the surface, lending themselves readily to burlesque, and affording plenty of material for ridicule.</p><p>Whitman's versification proceeds in the loosest possible fashion, discarding rhyme altogether, except in rare instances. A vague effect of rhythm is preserved, the cæsura recurring at irregular and often widely unequal intervals. It is an informal but roughly harmonious flow of words, sustaining the same relation to finished verse as the recitative to the aria. It is regarded by many as a startling innovation, but is really nothing more than a return to the earliest and most nearly spontaneous form of poetic expression. For purpose of comparison, as regards external form only, we place a passage from 'The Return of the Heroes' side by side with passages from the Sixty-fifth and One Hundred, and Fourth Psalms in the English version:</p><p>Loud O my throat, and clear O soul!<br>The season of thanks and the voice of full yielding,<br>The chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.</p><p>All tilled and untilled lands expand before me,<br>I see the true arenas of my race, or first or last,<br>Man's innocent and strong arenas.</p><p>I see the heroes of other toils,<br>I see well wielded in their hands the better weapons.</p><p>I see where the Mother of All.<br>With full-spanning eye gazes forth, dwells long.<br>And counts the varied gathering of the products.</p><p>Busy the far, the sunlit panorama,<br>Prairie,orchard, and yellow grain of the North,<br>Cotton and rice of the South, and Louisiana cane,<br>Open unseeded follows, rich fields of clover and timothy,<br>Kine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,<br>And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund <br>brook,<br>And healthy uplands with herby-perfumed breezes,<br>And the good, green grass, that delicate miracle the ever- <br>recurring grass.</p><p>———</p><p>Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion;<br>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh<br>come.<br>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness.</p><p>Thy paths drop fatness, they drop upon the pastures of<br>the wilderness;<br>And the little hills rejoice on every side.</p><p>The pastures are clothed with flocks.<br>The valleys also are covered over with corn.</p><p>Bless the Lord,O my soul!<br>O Lord, my God, thou art very great;<br>Thou art clothed with honor and majesty.</p><p>He watereth the hills from his chambers;<br>The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.<br>He sendeth the springs into the valleys;<br>By them shall the fowls of the heavens have their hab- itationhabitation.<br>They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild<br>asses quench their thirst.<br>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and the<br>herb for the service of man.</p><p>Again, we present the 'Address to the Sun,' of Ossian-Macpherson,1 in passages alternate with those of Walt Whitman's invocation of the same orb. In neither case is assistance given to the rhythm by artificial division of the verses. The interest of the comparison will be found to extend beyond the matter of form:</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers. Whence are thy beams, O Sun! thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the western way; but thou thyself movest alone.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling, thou hot October noon! Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand, the sibilant near sea with vistas far, and foam, and tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue; O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>Who can be a companion of thy course! The oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves decay with years: the ocean shrinks and grows again; the moon itself is lost in heaven; but thou art forever the same, rejoicing in the brightness of thy course.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Hear me illustrious! Thy lover me, for always have I loved thee, even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some wood-edge, thy touching-distant beams enough, or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>When the world is dark with tempests, when thunder rolls and lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm. But to Ossian thou lookest in vain, for he beholds thy beams no more: whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern clouds, or thou tremblest at the gates of the west.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Thou that with fructifying heat and light, o'er myriad farms, o'er land and waters North and South, o'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kanada's woods, o'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining inspace; thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas: thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally, shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting ray out of the million millions. Strike through these chants.</p><p><strong>OSSIAN.</strong></p><p>But thou art, perhaps, like me, for a season: thy years will have an end. Thou shalt sleep in thy clouds, careless of the voice of the morning. Exalt, then, O Sun, in the strength of thy youth! Age is dark and unlovely: it is like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines through broken clouds, and the mist is on the hills; the blast of the North is on the plain, the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey.</p><p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these; prepare the later afternoon of me myself—prepare my lengthening shadows, prepare my starry nights.</p><p>This reversion to a primitive mode of poetic expression is particularly interesting, occurring as it does at a time when a certain school of English- speaking poets are paying so much heed to the merely mechanical and musical qualities of verse. Whitman wastes no strength in the elaboration of metres, of rhyme, of assonance, of refrain. He does not stop to think of melody. There is no doubt that his method is that of the least friction—the least amount of idea rubbed off in the process of conformation. Nor is there any doubt that it is the method best suited to his genius; it seems to be the natural language of his genius. His sturdy egotism, his sympathy with living Nature and with Man in action, are poured forth in a torrent of words unhampered by the laws of prosody. Fancy the untamable, untranslatable Walt pottering over rondeaux, or elaborating canzonets, or measuring off fourteen lines to the idea! In the three or four poems which have rhyme and the stanza, the rhymes are of the crudest and the stanzas are fetters:</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done.<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought <br>is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and <br>daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O,the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>A strange thing about Whitman's rugged recitative is that it never becomes monotonous. Within apparently narrow limits of possible variation, he manages to secure a wonderful variety. His longest cumulative passages, his catalogues of natural objects, catalogues of occupations, geographical and physiological lists, are something more than catalogues and lists. The art may be unconscious, but the result shows him a perfect master of the poetic accent. Walt Whitman would have made the catalogue of ships in the 'Iliad' a poem in itself. Where his voice sounds in the minor key the music is often so dainty that we fail to notice the absence of the conventional lyric forms. Some lines in 'Sea Drift' sound like a snatch of one of Shakespeare's songs:</p><p>Two together! <br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north, <br>Day come white, or white come black, <br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home, <br>Singing all time, minding no time, <br>While we two keep together. </p><p><em>Low hangs the moon, it rose late, It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love— </em></p><p>We have been speaking of some of the surface characteristics of Walt Whitman's poetry. If all poets were in the habit of using this recitative rhythm as a vehicle for their thoughts, what qualities would still distinguish him from the rest?</p><p>It seems to us that Walt Whitman is the truest representative of the reactionary movement against romanticism—the movement in which Emile Zola is a noisy and mercenary incidental. What he has undertaken to do is to exhibit with absolute unreserve the mind of a modern man in its relations to nature and to modern society. See me, says Walt, the average man of the nineteenth century, just as I am, with all the conventions and lies and shame stripped off, leaving my intellectual and emotional processes absolutely naked to view. See me as I am, bodily, too, if you care for the spectacle—every rag stripped off. And thus unclad, morally and physically, he proceeds to execute all the gymnastic antics that suggest themselves to the imagination of the child of nature when he is freed from the restraint of clothing and set out in the sunlight.</p><p>It is not from any lack of conscientious intention that the poet fails in part of his purpose, and instead of achieving a portrait of the real Walt gives us an approximate Walt, a partly real, partly ideal Walt. No man that ever lived has succeeded in making a complete exposure of himself. In the most intimate confidences there are still nooks and corners over which vanity does and always will insist on drawing the veil. Still, Whitman goes at his work lustily, and with many advantages. The individuality which he exhibits is interesting. His courage is dauntless. His sympathy with the external world is genuine; his heart beats in true accord with the heart of nature. He is a born poet, with imagination of a high order—the imagination which creates new material instead of moulding old stuff into new forms. As compared with Tennyson, for instance, who justly admires him, he is an architect who has conceived a plan and built an edifice, not merely an artist engaged in beautifying with exquisite skill the walls of a structure centuries old. Walt Whitman has found poetry in the so-called commonplace objects of Nineteenth century life. He views at night the 'far-sprinkled systems,' but he views them through a Nineteenth century scuttle, constructed by a carpenter of today. The scuttle is as poetic an orifice as the oriel or the mullioned window of the bartizan tower; but,being an essentially modern conception, it does not enjoy the prestige which they have in conventional verse. Whitman exults in showing side by side the sublime or the beautiful that has always been acknowledged as such, and the sublime or the beautiful unacknowledged and unrecognized by everybody but himself. He goes forth at night and sings:</p><p>I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,<br>I call to the earth and sea half-held by night.<br>Press close, bare-bosomed night; press close magnetic, <br>nourishing night!<br>Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!<br>Still nodding night—mad naked summer night!</p><p>Smile O voluptuous cool breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty- <br>topt!<br>Earth or the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged <br>with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer <br>for my sake!<br>Far swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple blossom'd earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.<br>Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you <br>give love!<br>O unspeakable passionate love.</p><p>And with equal joy he contemplates the gigantic black driver of a dray:</p><p>The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the<br>block swags underneath it on its tied-over chain,<br>The negro that drives the long dray of the stone yard,<br>steady and tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string- <br>piece. <br>His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and<br>loosens over his hip band,<br>His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the<br>slouch of his hat away from his forehead.<br>The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on<br>the black of his polished and perfect limbs.</p><p>His idea of supreme beauty is man, at his best, in contact with nature—the naked body of the swimmer battling with the waves, the locomotive driving through the snowdrift, the woodsman swinging his broadaxe, the lusty farmer swinging his scythe, outdoor life, the ship at sea, muscle and pluck forever! No poet has ever echoed more accurately the whirr and roar of the restless, every-day life of the world, the infinitely complex movement of human activity, the rush of the planet through space, the resultant sound of all mingled sounds. This booms like the distant voice of the ocean in some of Goethe's lines, but Goethe never came nearer the laboratory of the universe than Whitman in 'Eidόlons':</p><p>Ever the dim beginning,<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle,<br>Ever the summit and the merge at last (to surely start <br>again),<br>Eidόlons! Eidόlons!</p><p>Ever the mutable,<br>Ever materials changing, crumbling, re-cohering,<br>Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,<br>Issuing Eidόlons!</p><p>The misfortune is that Walt Whitman, not content with his discovery of the value of the spirit of the Nineteenth century and the Modern Man as poetic material, seeks to elevate it into a democratic philosophy, or new religion of humanity. That he regards himself as the prophet of new ideas which loom awfully, but somewhat vaguely, behind the framework of his verses, is shown by abundant evidence. It would perhaps puzzle him to write out in cold prose the cardinal points of his social and religious philosophy, or, having done so, to demonstrate that they contain anything more than the ancient commonplaces. The abstract idea of universal brotherhood, of which the kiss between man and man is his not agreeable poetic type, the equality of man with man and of man with God, some taking truisms afforded by an imperfect acquaintance with the literature of metaphysical thought, a constant insistence on the doctrines of stirpiculture, a firm conviction in the majesty of the People—is not this the sum of the new creed of which he declares himself over and over again the embodiment, and which leads him to the final audacity of a comparison of his own mission with that of Christ?</p><p>E.

	"body": "<p>'Leaves of Grass.' </p><p>Liberty has received from the publishers, and joyfully welcomes Leaves of Grass, the collective title of Walt Whitman's poems. It is a convenient, compact, and tastefully 'got up' volume of 382 pages, and contains a number of hitherto unpublished poems, besides those of the earlier editions. 'Leaves of Grass' have lost nothing of their original native simplicity, freshness, and vigor from being more carefully arranged and placed in a more artistic, though it may be a more conventional vase. The book will be more readily purchased and read, at any rate; and that is the main point. The titles of some of the poems have been changed, and the table of contents newly arranged and made much more convenient for reference to special passages.</p><p>We have not discovered that the book has lost anything of its characteristic outspoken independence, nor that any concession has been made to Mrs. Grundy.1 It still retains all its naked truthfulness and purity, like its prototype in marble, the Greek Slave.<p><p>Walt Whitman is preeminently, above all and before all, the poet of innovation, the poet of change, the poet of growth, the poet of evolution. There is not a drop of stagnant blood in his veins. Every fibre of him quivers with life, energy, and fire. His spirit is at the same time the spirit of content and discontent. He is satisfied with whatever is and as it is—for to-day, but not for to-morrow, nor that for any future to-morrow.</p><p>Urge and urge and urge, <br>Always the procreant urge of the world.</p><p>That seems to him to be the key-note of the universe.</p><p>A study, 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' affords a good idea of what he himself considers his mission, and shows how thoroughly one in purpose that mission is with Liberty's. He shall speak for himself from that poem.</p><p>By Blue Ontario's shore,<br>As I mused of these warlike days and of peace return'd, and the <br>dead that return no more,<br>A Phantom gigantic superb, with stern visage accosted me,<br><em>Chant me the poem/</em> it said, <em>that comes from the sould of America, <br>Chant me the carol of victory, and strike up the marches of Lib- <br>ertad, marches more powerful yet, <br>And sing me before you go the song of the throes of Democracy. </em></p><p>The poet, in responding, commences with a striking bit of individual self-assertion, of which we can quote but a few lines:</p><p>A Nation announcing itself,<br>I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,<br>I reject none, accept all, then reporduce all in my own forms.</p><p>We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,<br>We are executive in ourselves,<br>We are sufficient in the variety of ourselves,<br>We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,<br>Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,<br>Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or <br>sinful in ourselves only.</p><p>(O mother—O sisters dear!<br>If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,<br>It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)</p><p>Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?<br>There can be any number of supremes . . . . <br>All is eligible to all,<br>All is for individuals, all is for you.</p><p>Produce great Persons, the rest follows.</p><p>Then comes this attack upon Authority and conservatism:</p><p>Piety and Conformity to them that like,<br>Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like,<br>I am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,<br>Crying, Leap from your seats and contend for your lives;<br>I am he who walks the States with a barb'd tongue, questioning <br>every one I meet,<br>Who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before?</p><p>Somewhat changing the theme:</p><p>I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,<br>I heard the voice arising demanding bards,<br>By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be <br>fused into the compact organism of a Nation.</p><p>To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no <br>account,<br>That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living princi-<br>ple, as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants.</p><p>Of these States the poet is the equable man,<br>For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,<br>For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,<br>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.</p><p>Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,<br>They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,<br>(Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been <br>always ready to fall for Liberty.)</p><p>For the great Idea,<br>That, O my brethren, that is the mission of poets.</p><p>A few lines to show what he claims for himself:</p><p>Give me the pay I have served for,<br>Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest.<br>I have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches,<br>Claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for <br>others on the same terms,<br>I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of <br>myself,<br>Rejecting none, permitting all.</p><p>We must find room for our poet's creed of Individualism, and close therewith our quotations from this remarkable book:</p><p>I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,<br>It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,<br>It is I who am great or to be great, it is you up there, or any one,<br>It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories,<br>Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.</p><p>Underneath all, individuals,<br>I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,<br>The only government is that which makes minute of individuals,<br>The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one single <br>individual—namely to you.<br>(Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners favor <br>the audacity and sublime turbulence of the States.)<br>Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments, own-<br>erships, I swear I perceive other lessons,<br>Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself, (the same monoto-<br>nous old song.)</p><br><p>I am for those that have never been master'd,<br>For men and women whose tempers have never been master'd,<br>For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master.<br>I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,<br>Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.</p><p>I will not be out-faced by irrational things,<br>I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,<br>I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,<br>This is what I have learnt from America—it is the amount, and it I <br>teach again.</p><p>(Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast,<br>I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams <br>your dilating form,<br>Saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.)</p><p>I will confront these shows of the day and night,<br>I will know if I am to be less than they,<br>I will see if I am not as majestic as they,<br>I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they,<br>I will see if I am to be less generous than they,<br>I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships have <br>meaning,<br>I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves, and <br>I am not to be enough for myself.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman's Claim to Be Considered a Great Poet. </p><p>———</p><p>Extracts From and Opinions On His 'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>———</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS.</p><p>Walt Whitman has issued a new and complete edition of his poems, with the same title as that given to his first volume, published in 1855, and reissued at Camden, N. J., some twenty years later. In his volume all the objectionable passages which were the cause of so much complaint at the time of their first appearance are given entire without a word changed or omitted. It was said of Mr. Mallock by an English reviewer, that in his last novel he had introduced 'the beastly into literature.' Considering some of the unexpurgated lines in this volume, Mr. Whitman is entitled to the honorable position of the apostle of the beastly in poetry. Nothing that Swinburne—a kindred unclean spirit, of greater intellectual power, however—ever wrote compares with the foulness of some of the 'good gray poet's' verse. The lines might be appropriate over the portals of a bawdy house, but not in a volume of poetry from a respectable publishing firm, intended for general circulation.</p><p>Mr. Whitman has been so long silent that the leading facts in his career are generally forgotten. He is now in his 63d year, having been born in 1819 at West Hills, on Long Island. His father was an Englishman and his mother from Holland. During his life he has worked as printer, carpenter, school-teacher, army-nurse, and clerk in the office of the Attorney-General. He has traveled quite extensively, and has suffered of late years from partial paralysis. For a proper appreciation of his poetry a peculiarly cultured taste is required. Claiming to be a writer for and of the people, those to whom Whitman appeals have shown the least sympathy with him and the greatest ignorance of the inspirations of his muse. Possibly we do not comprehend Whitman. Certainly we fail to enjoy what he is pleased to call his poetry. To any of Carlyle's heavily-capitalized pages the same title might be applied with equal force. The difficulty is to understand why it would not be equally effective and striking if entitled 'prose.' Take as an instance the poem entitled 'Our Old Feuillage':</p><p>Always our old feuillage!<br>Always Florida's green peninsula—always the <br>priceless delta of Louisiana—always the cot- <br>ton-fields of Alabama and Texas,<br>Always California's golden hills, and hollows, and <br>the silver mountains of New Mexico—always <br>soft-breath'd Cuba,<br>Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern <br>Sea, inseparable with the slopes drain'd by <br>the Eastern and Western Seas,<br>The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and <br>bay-coast on the main, the thirty thousand <br>miles of river navigation,<br>The seven millions of distinct families and the <br>same number of dwellings—always these, <br>and more, branching forth into numberless <br>branches,<br>Always the free range and diversity—always the <br>continent of Democracy;<br>Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast <br>cities, travelers, Kanada the snows:<br>Always these compact lands tied at the hips <br>with the belt stringing the huge oval lakes—</p><p>Thus, in the same strain, this so-called poetry runs on for four pages without a single period! It is true that Walt Whitman has been praised by such high authorities in literature as Emerson, Tennyson, and Ruskin. Their eulogies, however, were rather on the thoughts and sentiments of the author than praise of his versification. His power is rugged and his controlling impulse, apart from his egotism, is to say whatever occurs to him at the moment, whether relevant or irrelevant. He lacks both rhyme and rhythm. His is imaginative, but not metrical, composition; the fruit of an excited imagination, but without measured form. If we call him a great poet, and judge him by his writings, where shall we assign our Longfellow or Whittier, tried on the same kind of evidence? Macaulay has as broad and liberal a definition of ars poetica as anyone. 'By poetry,' he says, 'we mean the art of employing words in such a manner as to produce an illusion on the imagination; the art of doing by means of words what the painter does by means of colors.' Now, if we take one or two of Walt Whitman's best efforts, how does he fulfill these requirements? Here is a little bit called 'Aboard at a Ship's Helm':</p><p>Aboard at a ship's helm,<br>A young steersman steering with care.</p><p>Through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing,<br>An ocean-bell—O a warning bell rocked by the <br>waves.</p><p>O you give a good notice indeed, you bell by the <br>sea-reefs ringing,<br>Ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its <br>wreck-place.</p><p>For as on the alert O steersman, you mind the <br>loud admonition.<br>The bows turn, the freighted ship tacking speeds <br>away under her gray sails,<br>The beautiful and noble ship with all her pre-<br>cious wealth speeds away gayly and safe.</p><p>But O the ship, the immortal ship! O ship aboard <br>the ship!<br>Ship of the body, ship of the soul, voyaging, <br>voyaging, voyaging.</p><p>Or take a few lines from another poem:</p><p>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country <br>by road, lo, such faces!<br>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, <br>ideality,<br>The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome <br>common benevolent face,<br>The face of the singing of music, the grand faces <br>of natural lawyers and judges broad at the <br>back-top,<br>The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the <br>brows, the shaved blanched faces of ortho-<br>dox citizens,<br>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning <br>artist's face,<br>The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the hand-<br>some detested or despised face.</p><p>This now is too lamentable a face for a man.<br>Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing <br>for it,<br>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it <br>wrig to its hole.<br>. . . . . . .</p><p>The face is a haze more chill than the Arctic sea,<br>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they <br>go.</p><p>Milton defines poetry as 'thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers'; and Chatfield says, 'Poetry is the music of thought, conveyed to us in the music of language.' Joubert happily puts it, 'Nothing which does not transport is poetry. The lyre is a winged instrument.' Let us see, then how a few lines from Whitman's 'Song of Myself' come up to the requirements of these authorities:</p><p>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs <br>to you.</p><p>I loafe and invite my soul,<br>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of <br>summer grass.</p><p>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd <br>from this soil, this air.<br>Born here of parents born here from parents <br>the same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.</p><p>Creeds and schools in abeyance,<br>Retiring back awhile sufficed at what they are, <br>but never forgotten,<br>I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at <br>every hazard,<br>Nature without check with original energy.</p><p>Take some of the shorter poems. Here is an ode to 'Beautiful Women':</p><p>Women sit or move to and fro, some old, some <br>young,<br>The young are beautiful—but the old are more <br>beautiful than the young.</p><p>Here is another, entitled 'Thought':</p><p>Of obedience, faith, adhesiveness;<br>As I stand aloof and look there is to me some-<br>thing profoundly affecting in large masses <br>of men following the lead of those who do <br>not believe in men.</p><p>Ruskin considers that 'It is a shallow criticism that would define poetry as confined to literary productions in rhyme and metre. The written poem is only poetry talking, and the statue, the picture, and the musical composition are poetry acting. Milton and Goethe, at their desks, were not more truly poets than Phidias with his chisel, Raphael at his easel, or deaf Beethoven bending over his piano, inventing and producing strains which he himself could never hope to hear'—and this great critic, Ruskin, say Whitman's admirers, has praised our hero! So be it! Phidias and Raphael and Beethoven were judged in accordance with the merits of what they produced. Their 'acted poetry' stood the test of the most acute analysis and was given prominent rank because it was perfection. In the same manner 'talking poetry,' by whoever written, must satisfy the eye, the ear, the mind, the heart, all the higher mental faculties in order to be classed as true, genuine inspired poetry. Does this short poem meet these demands:</p><p><em>A GLIMPSE</em><br>A Glimpse, through an interstice caught,<br>Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-<br>room around the stove late of a winter <br>night, and I unremark'd seated in a corner,<br>Or a youth who loves me and whom I love, <br>silently approaching and seating himself <br>near, that he may hold me by the hand,<br>A long while amid the noises of coming and <br>going, of drinking and oath and smutty <br>jest,<br>There we two, content, happy in being to-<br>gether, speaking little, perhaps not a word.</p><p>See how easily Whitman's verse becomes prose, and what would be the spontaneous criticism on any author who should write such prose:</p><p><em>WALT WHITMAN.</em><br>Thou orb aloft full-dazzling, thou hot October noon! Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand, the sibilant near sea with vistas far, and foam, and tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue; O sun of noon refulgent! My special word to thee. Hear me illustrious! Thy lover me, for always have I loved thee, even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some woodedge, thy touching-distant beams enough, or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I launch my invocation. Thou that with fructifying beat and light, o'er myriad farms, o'er land and waters North and South, o'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas' grassy plains, Kanada's woods, o'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining in space; thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents, seas; thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild flowers givest so liberally, shed, shed thyself on mine and me, but with a fleeting ray out of the million millions. Strike through these chants. Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength for these; prepare the later afternoon of me myself—prepare my lengthening shadows, prepare my starry nights.</p><p>There is no thought of melody, of the mechanical requirements of verse. It is simply a combination of words like unto the bits of glass in the child's kaleidoscope. Is it the language of a real genius or the voice of a ponderous fool? Whitman himself partially answers the question in a song from which we have already quoted. He is:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son,<br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, and<br> breeding.<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women, or apart from them.<br>No more modest than immodest.<br>. . . . . . <br>I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all <br>so luscious. </p><p>This is the pen picture of himself by the man claiming to be the apostle of a new art, instead of being really the apostle of a great art in its most degraded form. There is no necessity for further quotation. We can admire the native, rugged strength of Whitman's unhampered genius. His active, brilliant imagination and his far-reaching enthusiasm seeking expression in language—in words that shall fire the heart and excite the mind—are characteristics of an extraordinary nature. So too his command of language and, apparently inexhaustible vocabulary is remarkable in a man with such antecedents and personal history. But these qualities do not make him a great poet. And to rank him as such is, to our thinking, to establish an entirely new standard from that which we have been wont to apply to the great masters of song. If they are true poets, then is Whitman a false one; if he is a poetic genius, then were the most honored names of literature but poetasters and 'pitiful rhymers.' </p><p>Published in Boston by J. R.

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN, complete at last, thanks to the patience and pluck of James R.Osgood & Co., the Boston publishers, speaks to the world by his new book, just issued in such shape and under such auspices as will win the world's wider attention. The book is running over with the writer's own personality and the two must be treated as one. Walt and his work are older, whiter, more mature; not wiser, but quieter; the mad turbulence hushed a little and some pruning done; yet the same sight, undimmed, immortal; Leaves of Grass, still green and vital as ever, but now growing close about many a solid rock of fame; the man and his work, among the oddest, if not the most beautiful, things of the present century.</p><p>I, the Titan, the hard-mouthed mechanic, spending my <br>life in the hurling of words.</p><p>In an age of short hair, and cropped beards, and close-fitting contained 'pants,' and neck wear, a man that persists in letting his hair and beard grow long, wears loose clothing, low-necked shirts and no collar or hatter at all, out-Byrons Byron, and if he can do all this, as Whitman does, and still maintain his self-respect, and not get hooted at on every street corner, that is, keep on his own way without fastening upon himself the obloquy of a quack and charlatan, it argues pretty strongly that there is unusual stuff in the animal somewhere. And the man who can name three hundred little songs and songlets, and somehow permeate each name with instinctive life that laughs at commonplace and each name an original fixed streak of genius in its way, not only not dull, but vividly descriptive, suggestive, is something out of the ordinary ranks of hacks in all lines. As to the poems, Emerson long ago said they were poetry; Tennyson, Swinburne, not to speak of vapid critics at home or abroad, affirm that Walt has written poetry. What is there left to be said? Much every day were there room to say it. Short and clear let the words be. It would be easy to pick a thousand lines from Whitman's three hundred and eighty-two pages that fairly breathe and bristle with power, that sparkle and flash with beauty, that are as unique in modern poetry as the brightest aurora that has filled the north skies for a generation and as rare as the few gem-like days of June. Now and then there are eclipses; sunlight and stars all gone out of the man and his word; but nature swings back to him, lo to it, and there is light again when the orbit is bound and nature attuned. It is life, seen and recorded. Never mind the egotism. That must come in somehow in all work. To jot it down more definitely, Whitman has eyes, looks into things, not at them. No long or steady gaze, no masterful comprehension of the great laws of the facts, but the facts he sees; furthermore, has the ability to report the fact as he sees it, as it is; yet further, to saturate all facts so seen and recorded with the momentary intense splendor of his own being. Name the being? The grade of it? Well, not Homeric; that was warlike, heroic, grand. Read the lines of Whitman's face and of his poetry: nothing of the Homeric or heroic is there. Not Shakespearean; that is art incarnate. Whitman is not an artist; not Virgilic or Dantic—that is culture and morality and sentiment and piety of a kind. Whitman has none of these. Not Emersonian or Tennysonian—that is scholarly—Whitman is the farthest removed from all that. What then? We answer, that what these all were to the distinctive spirit of their generations, though in utter contrast with them, Whitman is to the characteristic spirit of this generation—gigantic, rude, loud, prosy, mechanic, conceited. Whirling, unsettled, abounding in vitality, extent and power. In this light read Whitman's book, and lines fine, in their way, as any in Homer or Shakespeare shall flash on your soul, if you have a soul, and pleasure rich and rare as the lover finds in love, the poet in nature, and the banker in his margins shall press and pierce you almost to pain.</p>",

	"title": "Leaves of Grass",
	"body": "<p>LEAVES OF GRASS. </p><p>Since the issue, years ago, of a strange, thin volume, bearing this title, the thinkers of the world have been busy in attempting to read the riddle of these poems and their author. The struggle has raged fiercely about every point, from the question whether the term 'poem' can properly be applied to these odd recitatives at all, to the question of their meaning and their inspiration. The complete works of Walt Whitman are now put into the hands of the old generation and the new, to do what work they may; but by this time criticism should have crystallized into something definite, and the world ought not longer to go on wondering, each man scanning the face of his neighbor before venturing upon an opinion of his own. And first, let the old quarrel about the form of these poems be finally dismissed. The question of the fittest form for the expression of poetic ideas is as old as human thought, and different ages and nations have answered it differently. The modern rules of rhyme and accent would have seemed senseless to the Latin or Greek prosodists. All these matters are mere conventionalities; and if a man's genius direct him to write in measures hitherto unknown, why let him be judged independently of what are little more than the literary fashions of the day. Whitman's chants strike rudely on the ear at first; but there is in their very construction an element of the magnificent old Hebrew rhythm which marks the book of Job the grandest of epics. They are not mere accidental jumbles. The reader with an ear for music will detect a theme running through them all, which will satisfy him as well, if he be a thoughtful man, as if he could scan them glibly by anapests or trochees. That Whitman is a great poet, it does not require a long reading to discover. From this volume could be collected more absolutely fresh instances of that creative genius which is the progenitor of poetry than from any writer of modern times. Metaphors of singular fidelity and beauty, such as 'the fan-shaped explosions,' crowd upon and round out the lines. Who that has ever heard it can forget this one?—'The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp.' Many of his short poems are as clean-cut as crystals, and as melodious as more strictly measured cadences. The 'Drum Taps' are famous everywhere; and, though later efforts have been less happy, the one exquisite song, 'O, Captain! My Captain!' written on the death of Lincoln, would make him one of our honored poets forever. When mere formal objections are laid by, the most obvious surface criticism upon Whitman is his apparent egotism. It is everywhere 'I,' 'me imperturbe,' 'I project the history of the future,' 'You do not understand me, you cannot understand me, but I can wait hundreds of years for my audience, and they will understand and applaud me.' If these were merely the mouthings of individual pride, they would inspire deserved disgust. But they are the words of a man who has a message and proves it. Everywhere, to him who reads aright, the personality of the prophet is sunk out of sight, and the prophecy is exalted. This man feels that he has a message to the multitudinous generations. The grandeur of humanity, the oneness of creation, the beauty and the glory in that one word, 'life,' the meanness of social and artificial distinctions, the grand eternal sweep of cosmic laws, the dignity of everything that is, simply because it is, and the onward march of all things mean and great toward a wondrous destiny,—these are the high thoughts which reduce language almost to incoherence, and fill the seer with unutterable exaltation. Is not this the true humility of one who thinks much of his message and little of himself?—</p><p>The words of my book nothing, the drift of it <br>everything. <br>A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt <br>by the intellect, <br>But you ye untold latencies, will thrill to every <br>page.</p><p>His sympathy with everything in nature bea[rs] marks of that higher pantheism to which modern scientific and religious thought distinctly tend. His sinking of self, in the midst of seeming self-glorification, is the poet's tribute to the race. His apparently intuitive grasp of truth toward which knowledge laboriously gropes, has been firmly shown by Professor Clifford in his essay on 'Cosmic Emotion.' The wonderful new light that shines to-day upon poems written twenty years ago and since unchanged, but then unintelligible, is a better vindication of the inspiration behind them than all the work of critics and reviewers. Does any man claim that Whitman is weakly atheistic?</p><p>I say no man has ever yet been half devout <br>enough,<br>None has every yet adored or worship'd half <br>enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself <br>is, and how certain the future is.<br>All the things of the universe are perfect mir-<br>acles, each as profound as any.<br>The wonder is always and always how there can <br>be a mean man or an infidel.</p><p>He is religious enough, though not with the faith of the creeds. 'Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation.' He looks through nature to ultimate forces and exults in them.</p><p>And as to you Death, and you bitter tug of mortal-<br>ity, it is idle to try to alarm me.<br>And as to you Life, I reason you are the leavings of <br>many deaths.<br>I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,<br>O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers <br>and promotions.</p><p>He is, indeed a poet who sees far and keenly; and no doubt the reader of the future will believe it still more than we. One other current objection must be briefly met. Public and publishers have cried out upon his indecency. It is true that there are in this book things which no man observant of conventions would have dared to print. But it must be said of them, as he says of his poems, that the words are nothing, the tendency everything. His lines are bold and startling, but you can look them through and through and find no prurient suggestiveness. His aim is to glorify human nature as God made it, with powers complete but undefiled. Delicate modesty feeds upon Swinburne, but flees with down-drawn eyelids from Whitman; yet the pages of the latter are to those of the former what a gallery of Greek sculpture, filled with noble, life-like, marble figures, is to the cancan upon the stage of the Paris Varieties. The real, consistent criticisms upon Leaves of Grass have been uttered, if at all, but by few and with hesitation. Whitman seems to have in undue amount the author's tenderness, born perhaps, in this case, of his sense of the greatness of his mission, for every word he has written; and this has prevented the exclusion of worthless matter. The few lines, for instance, entitled The Ship Starting, contain neither thought nor figure of beauty that entitle them to life. And in his longer poems the tiresome enumerations of States, countries and avocations, which sometimes spread over pages, are but the wanderings of heated imagination and vivid fancy, detracting from both the inner thought and the outer artistic effect. To cut down the volume probably one-fourth, if judiciously done, would exclude nothing of present or possible future value. The constant use of such words as 'ostent,' 'sidle,' 'sluing,' and the like, is bad English and worse taste. Again, he is open to the charge of making his thought unnecessarily obscure. Doubtless he himself cannot grasp in their fullness all the mighty ideas which float illusively before him. He is like a child attempting to describe Niagara, or like him who could not utter a word of the things he saw and heard, when caught up to heaven in a vision. But he is, nevertheless, unnecessarily mystic and incoherent. Those who have penetrated to the heart of one of his Delphic sayings can see that its intent was purposely shrouded in vague, verbal involutions. Not only might he have sooner won his place, but he might have done better the work in which he glories, had he courted the strong simplicity which none is better able to master. Leaves of Grass has won its own way, and is sure of its place. Few American authors have the reputation abroad which Whitman has attained. At home he is destined to a closer and more admiring study as the years go by. From such a discipline it is not impossible that a greater future poet may draw virility and inspiration, while avoiding errors which impair the strength and the popular influence of a work unique, original, careless of standards and traditions, yet replete with beauty and power.</p>",

	"title": "Recent Poetry",
	"body": "<p>[ . . .] We have read anew, from a sense of duty, the original and unexpurgated Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman, as now reprinted, with some milder additions (Osgood). It cannot be said of them, as Sir Charles Pomander, in 'Christie Johnstone,' says of his broken statues, that 'time has impaired their indelicacy.' This somewhat nauseating quality remains in full force, and we see no good in their publication except to abate the outcries of the Liberal League against Mr. Anthony Comstock and his laws respecting obscene publications. So long as Leaves of Grass may be sent through the mails, the country is safe from over-prudery, at least. Mr. Whitman is often ranked with the 'fleshly school,' and his circle of English admirers is almost identical with the coterie whose apostles are Swinburne and Wilde. But the erotic poems of these authors are to those of Whitman as rose-water to vitriol. The English poets have at their worst some thin veneering of personal emotion; with Whitman there seems no gleam of anything personal, much less of that simple, generous impulse which makes almost every young man throw some halo of ideal charm about the object of his adoration. Whitman's love, if such it can be called, is the sheer animal longing of sex for sex—the impulse of the savage, who knocks down the first woman he sees, and drags her to his cave. On the whole, the condition of the savage seems the more wholesome, for he simply gratifies his brute lust and writes no resounding lines about it. </p><p>Leaving this disagreeable aspect of the matter, we are impressed anew, on reading these poems, by a certain quality of hollowness, which is nowhere more felt than in the strains called 'Drum-Taps.' It would be scarcely worth while to bring these strains to any personal test, perhaps, did not Mr. Whitman's admirers so constantly intrude his personality upon us; but we cannot quite forget what Emerson says, that 'it makes a great difference to a sentence whether there be a man behind it or no.' When Mr. Whitman speaks with utter contempt of the 'civilian' (p. 252), and claps the soldier on the back as 'camerado' (p. 251), we cannot help thinking of Thackeray's burly and peaceful Jos. Sedley at Brussels, just before the battle of Waterloo, striding and swaggering between two military officers, and looking far more warlike than either. One can be aroused to some enthusiasm over the pallid shop-boy or the bookish undergraduate who knew no better than to shoulder his musket and march to the front in the war for the Union; but it is difficult to awaken any such emotion for a stalwart poet, who—with the finest physique in America, as his friends asserted, and claiming an unbounded influence over the 'roughs' of New York—preferred to pass by the recruiting-office and take service in the hospital with the non-combatants.</p><p>When we come to purely intellectual traits, it is a curious fact that Mr. Whitman, by the production of one fine poem, has overthrown his whole poetic theory. Dozens of pages of his rhythmic prose are not worth 'My Captain,' which among all his compositions comes the nearest to accepting the restraints of ordinary rhyme. His success in this shows that he too may yet be compelled to recognize form as an element in poetic power. The discovery may have come too late, but unless he can regard its lessons he is likely to leave scarcely a complete work that will be remembered; only here and there a phrase, an epithet, a fine note—as when the midnight tolling for General Garfield is called 'The sobbing of the bells.' These are the passages which his especial admirers style 'Homeric,' but which we should rather call Ossianic. The shadowy Gaelic bard rejected the restraints of verse, like Whitman, and reiterated his peculiar images with wearisome diffuseness and minuteness. To be sure, he was not an egotist, and he kept within the limits of decency; but he gave fine glimpses and pictures, while there was always a certain large, free atmosphere about all his works. They were translated into all languages; he was ranked with Homer and Virgil; Goethe and Napoleon Bonaparte were his warm admirers—and the collections of English poetry do not now include a line of his composing. If Whitman, after the same length of time, proves more fortunate, it will be because he wrote 'My Captain.'</p><p>Extremes meet, and many of Mr. Whitman's admirers are also enamored of the peculiarly hot-house atmosphere of Mr. Rossetti. We may be mistaken, but we see in his new volume a healthier strain than before, both in the sonnets added and in the subtraction of others. [ . . .]</p>",

	"body": "<p>THE FIRST AMERICAN POET. </p><p>———</p><p>Walt Whitman—Justice at last—A Great Poet Completes a Great Work.</p><p>———</p><p>The announcement was made some time ago that Walt Whitman was in Boston personally superintending the publication of his poems under the title of 'Leaves of Grass,' the name used in issuing his first thin volume, which threw all the conventional critics into spasms of laughter and disgust. But twenty years have wrought a mighty change. Whitman has steadily grown in favor in Europe and hence his own countrymen have taken him up and have gradually come to see that a great and original poet has been among them.</p><p>James R. Osgood & Co., of Boston, have just issued a volume of 382 pages containing Whitman's complete works. It is now discovered that from the beginning the poet had a purpose to which he has steadily adhered; that for thirty years he has been laboring on a great work with one aim, and that what seemed fragmentary were the parts of a great whole, the segments of a mighty circle, which the purblind public could not see or comprehend at one view.</p><p>The Pioneer Press a few days ago noticed these poems in a column article, doing justice to the poems and the poet. From England and America we expect to hear a reversal of the judgment of the flippant and shallow critics of twenty years ago and henceforth Walt Whitman will take a permanent place in history as the father and founder of a distinctively American literature.</p><p>We rejoice at this, for we were among those who first hailed Whitman as a poetic star of great magnitude rising over the horizon. In the year 1860, we published a literary paper called 'The Fireside,' in which we devoted a page to Whitman, quoting from the Westminster Review an adverse criticism and taking issue with the shallow reviewer. The British review thus spoke of the poems:</p><p>In form these poems, if poems they can be called, are composed of irregular rhythmical lines, after the manner of Tupper, and in fact they may be described by the following equation: as Tupper is to English Humdrum, so is Walt Whitman to American Rowdy.</p><p>That a drunken Helot should display himself without shame in the market place, speaks sad reproach to the public that does not scourge him back to his cellar.</p><p>To this the Cincinnati Commercial added:</p><p>This is deserved, and yet there are dirty dogs and dunces who praise Whitman's indecency, and call him a 'masculine poet' because he is an obscure ass.</p><p>In reply to this we said twenty-one years ago, page 106 of the 'Fireside':</p><p>Nevertheless, Walt Whitman is a poet. We expected better things of the Westminster Review. The above is of that shallow kind of criticism which flounders about on the surface and cannot reach down and feel the drift and great undercurrent of a work. Whitman is as much a word-painter as Bryant and a great deal more original, simple and masculine. No writer has ever given such a complete and natural picture of the external life of America. The man who is too much shocked by its 'indecency' to find any beauty in 'Leaves of Grass,' must have a very tasty taste. Whitman is a poet, but a poet rather in the rough.</p><p>We envy Mr. Conway, of the 'Dial,' his remark, viz: 'Walt Whitman has set the pulses of America to music.' There is more justness and appreciation, and comprehensive criticism in that short sentence than in all the conservative critics have said about Whitman.</p><p>We well remember how the 'thothiety' editors and the smart youths whose conception of poetry extended only to 'Marco Bozzaris' and 'Hohenlinden' jeered at these poems! How they referred to the poet himself as a product of the 'Brooklyn Flats' and as the 'red-shirted omnibus driver' of the metropolis. Yet Walt Whitman has made a profound impression on his time. And while he will probably not be generally read any more than Chaucer is. Yet the time will come when Whitman will be looked upon as the father of an American literature, that is of a literature distinctively and in all respects American, without any kingly, or monarchical or European influences in it.—He has laid the foundations, started the idea, of a genuine Democratic, New World, thoroughly American literature, and after him will come some great poet who will be the Shakspeare to this Chaucer. Moreover he is a genuine American man, the most original and truest Democrat of his time. The man is greater than his poems. His works, as the expression of a thoroughly original, democratic, human being, are invaluable, and on this foundation some mighty genius hereafter will build a literature and the gates of hell and time shall not prevail against it. Longfellow, Bryant, Whittier, Lowell and the rest will be remembered in the Cyclopedias as poets who did creditable work in English literature, but Whitman and his class will loom over the future as the founders and makers of an American literature.</p>",

	"title": "Review of Leaves of Grass (1881-82)",
	"body": "<p>LEAVES OF GRASS BY WALT WHITMAN. One vol. 12mo (7 5/8 x 5 1/4 in.), 352pp. containing all his poems under the headings 'Inscription,' 'Children of Adam,' 'Calamus,' 'Birds of Passage,' 'Sea-Drift,' 'By the Roadside,' 'Drum-Taps,' 'Memories of President Lincoln,' 'Autumn Rivulets,' 'Whispers of Heavenly Death,' 'From Noon to Starry Night,' 'Songs of Parting.' Portrait; cloth; $2 00. Boston: James R. Osgood & Co. </p><p>The prophet, of whom it was once said that he was not without honor except in his own country, has now, if not a circle of disciples, certainly a large and increasing audience of admirers. Several magazines and newspapers, which either received the words of 'the Good Gray Poet' with abuse, or refused to allow their pages to be sullied with a notice of his 'monstrosities,' now welcome his life-work with little short of unstinted praise. Nor is this due to the fact that a great publishing house gives its imprint to the title page. The reason lies deeper. While upon some natures his name still has the effect of the traditional red rag upon the angry bull, the majority of cultivated minds begin to see that Walt Whitman is the most American of poets and one of the brightest lights of American literature. It is worth while, then, for even very briefly to examine some of the adverse criticisms that have been passed upon Mr. Whitman, and to see how much weight they really have.</p><p>First, it is said that the form into which he throws his verse is chaotic, that his poems run to 'a chaos of monotonies,' and hence his book makes war upon all theories of true poetry. The same criticism would shut out of the category the English Psalms of David, and the best and most satisfactory translations of Homer and the Greek dramatists, Virgil and Dante, Goethe and Victor Hugo. These authors are still poets in the most literal translation, and the man who can read Whitman and find no rhythm lacks a musical ear. He has the most astounding variety of meters suited to every slightest change of sentiment, here lilting like a smooth flowing river, here carrying the reader along with all the rush of a Niagara, and again blocking itself with wonderful expressiveness. A study of Whitman's meters would be no more interesting and instructive than that which is spent on the complicated, and to us moderns the meaningless, systems of the Greek strophe and antistrophe. Take these four lines from 'A Broadway Pageant.' They are worthy of Horace:</p><p>'Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,<br>Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,<br>Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, <br>impassive,<br>Ride to-day through Manhattan.'</p><p>And hundreds of other instances could be given. Again, it is said that the catalogues with which Walt Whitman loads his poems are unpoetical. Without attempting to argue the point it may be said that were all records of America destroyed and Walt Whitman's poems preserved, the daily life of the nineteenth century might be pictured with almost photographic accuracy from the same much-abused catalogues; and, moreover, if anyone reads them understandingly he will not fail to be impressed with their picturesqueness and contrast their felicity of descriptiveness, and, taken in connection with the plan of the whole work, their appropriateness. And this brings us to a third adverse criticism: That the work has no unity of plan. To a narrow conception this is true. It needs a wide perspective, and, if these poems had been left to us by an ancient bard, they would have been prized as the most precious memorial of the past. The old story of the sculptor is not inapplicable here. Seen from a level at a short distance the statue appeared monstrous and coarse; but when erected upon its proper height, the rude lines melted into softness and the coarse features were seen to be simply majestic. His boldness of touch is admirable; his pages are veritable panoramas of life; his observation is all-embracing; nothing fails in the picture, and he is equally at home on the wide plains of the West, the wind-swept 'gray beach' of the Paumanok shore, or amid the eddying swarms of the city. His adjectives are often worthy of Homer, and his view of the universe wider than Goethe's. </p><p>A common charge against Mr. Whitman, is that of his overweening vanity. It must be admitted that if his every utterance be taken as the expression of his personal individual feeling, vanity could not go further; it would be the acme of conceit. But this again is a narrow view. Mr. Whitman symbolizes himself in the grandeur, the spread, the vast liberty of the man. It is the ideal of self-conscious Pantheism. 'The Song of Myself,' is not Walt Whitman in any small way. Myself is man idealized, and every pleasure, every passion, every pain which goes to make up the life of the world, is centred upon him as a sentient being capable of all things. Looked upon ideally, therefore, there is no conceit in it; aside from its form, it is the grandest conception of poetry which this century has given, and, if read without prejudice, cannot fail to stir the heart. The egotism is the egotism of the poet, and may be seen in these lines from the greatest of the Welsh bards, which bear a curious similarity in form to Mr. Whitman's poems, though possessing individuality of their own:</p><p>'Primary chief bard am I to Elphin,<br>And my original country is the region of the Sum-<br>mer Stars.<br>I was with my Lord in the highest sphere,<br>On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell;<br>I have borne a banner before Alexander;<br>I know the names of the stars from North to South;<br>I have been on the Milky Way at the throne of the <br>Distributor;<br>I have been winged by the genius of the splendid <br>crozier;<br>I have been loquacious prior to being gifted with<br>speech;<br>I am a wonder whose origin is not known;<br>I have been in Asia with Noah in the ark;<br>I have seen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra;<br>I have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass;<br>I have been in the armament with Mary Magda-<br>lene;<br>I have suffered hunger for the Son of the Virgin;<br>I have been fostered in the land of the Deity;<br>I am teacher to all intelligences;<br>I am able to instruct the whole universe;<br>I shall be until the day of doom on the face of the <br>earth;<br>And it is not known whether my body is flesh or <br>fish.'</p><p>And it is said that when Taliesin had finished his song, the kings who heard it were filled with marvel. </p><p>A still further objection, and the most serious one which has been urged against Mr. Whitman, is on the score of morality. It is claimed that he sins against purity, that he is the poet of the phallus and unbridled lust and indecency. Such a charge is extravagant. The lines which could be condemned on such a plea bear but a small proportion to the rest, and it may be said in defense that were its immodesty to shut it out from libraries, the Bible, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe, and most of the master-pieces of literature would have to suffer in the same way. Again, it was not written for babes and sucklings, and the person who can get food for vile imaginings from it would be fed equally from a thousand other sources; honi soit qui mal y pense. It can hurt no true man or woman. As regards the question of taste, the chemical view of matter which can reduce a vile and a pleasant odor, rot and sweet, smut and diamond-dust to the same elements is not the most conducive to poetry, and here it seems as though Mr. Whitman failed. Granting his premises that 'If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,' still personal preferences, the love of the beautiful, the true, the high, the noble, the best that is meant in the word 'taste,' is also a part of human nature and therefore superior to the excremental, the disagreeably physical view of man. Mr. Whitman might have consistently taken this ground and raised his poems immeasurably in the eyes of the world which he claims to love, by expunging a few expressions which cannot fail to offend the taste of the reader. Some think it a greater sin to break the laws of good taste than those of morality. Moreover, it is a question whether the attempt to carry out his colossal plan of depicting humanity in its every phase is worth while, since it places his most stimulating, most inspired and grandest utterances out of the kin of the very boys and girls who are growing up into the future men and women, which his verse exalts. We believe in an expurgated Bible, an expurgated Shakespeare and an expurgated Whitman, at least for the use of the young. The question of Mr. Whitman's sins against the English language is of less consequence. Good taste would alter a few; others which make the critics howl are legitimate if North and South, East and West and the [sic] all the French, German, Spanish elements of our country be taken [into] consideration.</p><p>We have assumed all along that Mr. Whitman is a poet. Some critics deny this, but we venture to say that had Leaves of Grass come down to us from antiquity, it would be the universal claim that they had the sweep and magnificence of the epic and the variety and expression of the lyric. There are poems in 'Drum Taps' which stir the heart like a bugle:</p><p>'Beat! beat! drums!—blow! bugles! blow.<br>Through the windows, through doors, burst like a <br>ruthless force,<br>Into the solemn church and scatter the congrega-<br>tion,<br>Into the school where the scholar is studying;<br>Leave not the bridegroom quiet—no happine[ss]<br>must he have with his bride,<br>Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing [his] <br>field or gathering his grain,<br>So fierce you whirr and pound yon drum—so sh[gap] <br>yon bugles blow.'</p><p>King David would not have been ashamed [of] this psalm:</p><p>'Proud music of the storm,<br>Blast that careers so fine, whistling among the [gap] <br>ries,<br>Strong hum of forest tree-tops—wind of the [moun-] <br>tains,<br>Personified dim shapes—you hidden [gap]<br>You serenades of phantoms with instru[gap]<br>Blinding with Nature's rhythmus all th[gap] <br>nations;<br>You chords left as by vast composers [gap]<br>You formless, tree, religious dan[gap] <br>Orient,<br>You undertone of rivers, roar of [gap]<br>You sounds from distant [gap] <br>Cavalry.<br>Echoes of camps, with all th[gap]<br>Trooping tumultuous, all[gap] <br>bending me powerless[gap]<br>Entering my lonesome [gap] <br>You seized me?'</p><p>Without even [gap] any definite way [gap] hesitate to place [gap] 'though you are.' Some of Whitman's readers have fancied that of late he would have been glad to omit some of the Adamic verse but for pride; and have in fact felt as if his theory of poetry might be the in some measure invented to fit the facts and justify them, rather than have been the source and mold of them. As good a thing as has ever been said of Whitman's work in this direction is contained in a review in a previous number of the Critic. Speaking of the old 'dilettante atmosphere' of our literature, without vital connection with the life of the country, the reviewer says—</p><p>'Into this hot-house air of literature Walt Whitman bounded, with the vigor and suppleness of a clown at a funeral. Dire were the grimaces of the mourners in high places, and dire are their grimaces still. There were plenty of criticisms to make, even after one had finished crying Oh! at the frank sensuality, the unbelievable nakedness of Walt. Everything that decent folk covered up, Walt exhibited, and boasted of exhibiting! He was proud of his nakedness and sensuality. He cried, Look here, you pampered rogues of literature, what are you squirming about, when you know, and everybody knows, that things are just like this, always have been, always will be? But it must be remembered that this is what he wrote, and that he did it with a plan, and by order from his genius. It has never been heard of him that he was disgusting in talk or vile in private life, while it has been known that poets celebrated for the lofty tone of their morality, for the strictness of their Christianity, the purity of their cabinet hymns, can condescend in private life to wallow in all that is base.'</p><p>Well worth quoting, before we leave the two great Americans, is what Walt says of Emerson: 'Amid the utter delirium-disease called bookmaking, its feverish cohorts filling our world with every form of dislocation, morbidity, and special type of anemia or exceptionalism (with the propelling idea of getting the most possible money, first of all), how comforting to know of an author who has, through a long life, and in spirit, written as honestly, spontaneously and innocently as the sun shines or the wheat grows—the truest, sanest, most moral, sweetest literary man on record—unsoiled by pecuniary or any other warp—ever teaching the law within—ever loyally outcropping his own self only—his own poetic and devout soul!'</p>",

As usual in such cases, the reaction increased the demand for the book to such an extent that several new editions have been called for and it is found on the shelves of book stores side by side with Longfellow and Tennyson, in the home and in public libraries, where the critical reader or student of verse can have access to it, and the human nature that can suffer from any undue license of the poetic imagination which Walt Whitman has transcribed on these pages must be very weak indeed and easily harmed.</p><p>There is not a line of prefatory writing in Leaves of Grass, not a foot note to clear up the passages in nature which God has left obscure; the writer does not explain that the poems were a result of a few idle hours or the reveries of an invalid convalescing from an attack of mania a potu or typhoid fever; he pours out his thoughts about everything in a flood of incoherent and incohesive language, and borne on its resistless flow we find all that floods bear with them, debris, flotsam jewels—tarns of still deep beauty jewels—precious, perishing lovely things that we haste to snatch from the rubbish and make our own. His interest in humanity and his claim that all the world is kin, he expresses with natural humility:</p><p>These are really the thoughts of all men in all <br>ages and lands, they are not original with me;<br>If they are not yours as much as mine they are <br>nothing or next to nothing;<br>If they are the riddle and the untying of the <br>riddle, they are nothing or next to nothing;<br>This is the grass that grows wherever the land is <br>and the water is;<br>This is the common air that bathes the globe.</p><p>Can any pen-picture of nature be finer than his apostrophe to the earth on page 76? </p><p>'Smile O voluptuous cool-breathed earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunsets—earth of the mount-<br>ains misty top!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just <br>tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbowed earth—rich apple-blos- <br>somed earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.<br>Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to <br>you give love.<br>O unspeakable passionate love!</p><p>There seems to be no earthly property however small, insignificant and remote, that this grand poet of nature does not invest with the beauty and glory of poesy as he does when he calls the common field grass 'the beautiful uncut hair of graves,' a line that in itself should immortalize him; he walks among the herds of cattle and gives us this lesson:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they <br>are so placid and self-contained,<br>I stand and look at them long and long;<br>They do not sweat and whine about their condi-<br>tion;<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and whine <br>about their sins;<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty <br>to God.<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with <br>the mania of owning things.<br>Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that <br>lived thousands of years ago;<br>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the <br>whole earth.'</p><p>The self-elected critic who said that Shakespeare was not a poet—his verses didn't rhyme—would make a similar objection to Walt Whitman. To the dull, untuned ear of the prosaic soul they would convey neither rhythm nor rhyme, but Poetry herself might sit entranced at his feet as the mellow numbers flow in tranquil rhythmic measure from his lips. Here are snatches selected at random, any one of which would be sufficient to redeem a volume from wastage:</p><p>The old face of the mother of many children, <br>Whist! I am fully content.</p><p>Behold a woman:<br>She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is <br>clearer and more beautiful than the sky.</p><p>She sits in an arm-chair under the shaded porch <br>of the farm-house.</p><p>The sun just shines on her old white head.<br>Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen.<br>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-<br>daughters spun it with the distaff and the <br>wheel.</p><p>The melodious character of the earth,<br>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go <br>and does not wish to go.</p><p>The justified mother of men.</p><p><em>MOTHER AND BABE.</em><br>I see the sleeping babe nestling the breast of <br>its mother,<br>The sleeping mother and babe—hush'd, I study <br>them long.</p><p><em>A CHILD'S AMAZE.</em><br>Silent and amazed, even when a little boy,<br>I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday <br>put God in his statements<br>As contending against some being or influence.</p><p><em>BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.</em><br>Women sit, or move to and fro—some old, <br>some young.<br>The young are beautiful; but the old are more <br>beautiful than the young.</p><p>The poet's allusions to death are among the finest passages in his works, and his songs of parting are something more than tricks of pathos; they are the outcome of sorrow's cleansing fires in his own heart. The Camps of Green is a poem engendered by war scenes.</p><p>'To the camps of the tents of green,<br>Which the days of peace kept filling, <br>And the days of war kept filling.<br>With a mystic army; is it too ordered<br>Forward? is it too only halting awhile,<br>Till night and sleep pass over?</p><p><em>JOY, SHIPMATE, JOY!</em><br>Joy, shipmate, joy.<br>Pleased to my soul at death I cry<br>Our life is closed, our life begins<br>The long, long anchorage we leave;<br>The ship is clear at last she leaps,<br>She swiftly courses from the shore<br>Joy, shipmate, joy.</p><p>The exquisitely mournful tribute to the memory of President Lincoln is familiar [to] the reader but it will bear producing here.</p><p><em>O CAPTAIN, MY CAPTAIN!</em><br>O Captain, my Captain! our fearful trip is done<br>The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we <br>sought is won<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel <br>grim and daring;</p><p>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain, my Captain, rise up and hear the bells.<br>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the <br>bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you <br>the shore a crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning.</p><p>Here Captain, dear father<br>This arm beneath your head<br>Is it some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead?</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale <br>and still<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will<br>The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage <br>closed and done<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won.</p><p>Exult O shores, and ring O bells,<br>But I with mournful tread<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>To analyze a flower is to kill it; the same might be said of the majority of even fine poems, but there are some that dissected fall into pictures and the above is one of these; the two lines</p><p>'Here, captain, dear father,<br>This arm beneath your head'</p><p>have the heroism of a soldier and the tenderness of a woman in them, while they instantly convey to the mind a picture, alas! too common to excite alarm or wonder, but inexpressively touching. It has been Walt Whitman's destiny to commemorate in verse the deaths of two captains of the ship of state, but to him the first was a personal loss. Of the last, midnight, September 19, he writes of</p><p>The sobbing of the bells—<br>—Those heart-beats of a nation in the night</p><p>Emerson appears to have accepted the poet, if we may believe the assertion of an unknown writer that he approved of Leaves of Grass. It would need one of Emersonian breadth to appreciate the vigor, the intensity, the strong balancing of all mental and physical forces in this redundancy of verse. The book is full of such salt-sea breezes of expression as these:</p><p>O the joy of a manly selfhood!<br>To be servile to none to defer to none, not to any <br>tyrant known or unknown;<br>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy <br>and elastic;<br>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye;<br>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a <br>broad chest;<br>To confront with your personality all the other <br>personalities of the earth.'</p><p>That verse or sentence alone could be profitably engraved upon the pages of every school reader in the land, yet doubtless there are hypercritical readers who would cavil at the second line and find in it a furtive attack on all the known systems of theology.</p><p>And is there nothing in the book to condemn? Yes, there are whole pages of 'magnificent uncleanness' which have no excuse for being. They are gross with the grossness of the 18th century, when people do not call a spade a spade, and are shocked by ungloved hands. In reference to the position which a part of the public has taken towards the book we are reminded of the answer Henry Ward Beecher gave to a gentleman who at an exhibition of statuary asked, 'Are those statues indecent, Mr. Beecher?'</p><p>'No, sir,' was the severe answer, 'but your question is.'</p><p>The poet is an old man now, the fires of youth have burned themselves to ashes, yet when he was called upon to revise the present edition of his work he would not alter or omit a line of his earlier writings. The calm pulse of age approved the turbulent blood of his youth when he wrote of himself:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a Kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son<br>Turbulent, fleshly, sensual, eating, drinking and <br>breeding<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women, or apart from them,<br>No more modest or immodest.<br>A morning glory at my window satisfies me more <br>than the metaphysics of books.'</p><p>And this man in his old age is beloved of women and children, and the childlike tenderness and simplicity of his nature are revealed in the following incident:</p><p>'In the middle of the room in its white coffin, lay the dead child, the nephew of the poet. Near it in a great chair, sat Walt Whitman surrounded by little ones, and holding a beautiful little girl on his lap. She looked wonderingly at the spectacle of death and then inquiringly into the old man's face. 'You don't know what it is, do you, my dear,' said he, and added, 'we don't either.' </p>",

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS. </p><p>When James R. Osgood & Co., of Boston, concluded to bring out a revised and enlarged edition of WALT WHITMAN's 'Leaves of Grass,' they did the best thing possible for American literature, and performed an act of justice towards the most thoroughly original of American bards. WALT WHITMAN is in himself—and in his book, which is himself—the soul of the new and generous continent. He has its asserting egotism, its crude force, its prolific and bounteous vitality. He has the abounding hospitality, the inspiriting positivism of a people that have girdled the forests and chained the mountains and linked to the respectable traditions of a dead past the vital energies of the living present, and who see in the future they shall conquer, the fulfillment of their dearest prophecies and their divinest expectations.</p><p>Reading carefully the nearly three hundred pages of 'Leaves of Grass' the student, both of literature and of humanity, can but wonder at the strange power that manifests itself in every paragraph. They may criticise the form of expression, may question the taste of certain passages, but the overlying grace of the poet and the underlying spirit of the philanthropist animate every part. Here is the vigor and splendor that have called forth the admiration of an EMERSON, a LONGFELLOW and a TENNYSON. It is the largeness and vitality of the primal man—the gigantic and multiplied possibilities of a continent of vast lakes and praries, and rivers and mountains and far-reaching, fertile plains. The effeminate and hot-house reader has no need of its pages. As well could he exchange his satin-covered and rose-scented couch for a bed among the pine boughs of the Sierras. Its living imagery and masterly action is to them both coarse and crude. This Elijah in the wilderness, with his coarse vesture and fiery self-assertion, is quite as much an object of scorn to the dainty esthetes as was the old prophet to the college boys who shouted, 'Go up thou bald head!' But the new bard is a prophet too, and as such is willing to wait the slow appreciation that comes to the forerunner in any line. Nearing the conclusion of his volume he says:—</p><p>'When America does what was promised,<br>When through these States walk a hund-<br>red millions of superb persons,<br>When the rest part away for superb per-<br>sons and contribute to them,<br>When breeds of the most perfect mothers <br>denote America,<br>Then to me and mine our due fruition.'</p><p.WALT WHITMAN is the poet of democracy, of strict and absolute equality, who exalts woman alike with man. He is the poet of powerful figures, and there is nothing outside of HOMER and the Bible that equals the splendor of his imagery or the elevation of an occasional passage. The thirty-six pages of military verse under the heading 'Drum Taps' contain matchless descriptions of scenes of camp and battle, unequalled by those of any modern writer. 'Autumn Rivulets' and 'From Noon to Starry Night' are full of indescribable flights. Quoting from the closing poem again, 'So Long,' the poet prophesies of what shall come after him:</p><p>'I announce natural persons to rise,<br>I announce justice triumphant,<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and <br>equality,<br>I announce the justification of candor and <br>the justification of pride.</p><p>I announce a life copious, vehement, <br>spiritual, bold,<br>I announce the end that shall lightly and <br>joyfully meet its translation.'</p><p>After all that has been written it is scarcely necessary for us to add that while there are passages in 'Leaves of Grass' that for the sake of the immature and casual reader we would gladly obliterate, yet as a sign of the time when a distinctively American school of literature shall arise, vigorous, wholesome, pure, breezy as the praries and lofty as the Sierras, we welcome WALT WHITMAN and his book. It is a splendid protest against the fine spun and sickly effeminacy of the AMANDA MATILDA poetry of the American magazine. It is very strong meat but good for vigorous digestion. 'Camerado,' we return your kiss. Though 'disembodied, triumphant, dead,' you will dwell forever in the epic of democracy.</p>",

	"body": "<p>LEAVES OF GRASS By Walt Whitman. Boston: James B. Osgood & Co. Detroit: Thorndike Nourse. </p><p>That Walt Whitman is genuine and thoroughly believes in himself is beyond question. It does not therefore follow that he is a poet, though we have noticed that those who insist most strenuously upon his claim to be so considered, base the claim mainly on his genuineness and self-confidence, waiving for the moment all discussion as to the beastliness of certain of his verses—there really is no other word which fitly characterizes them—his poems, so-called, very rarely furnish any excuse for their appearance in the poetic form. There is no rhyme or pretense of any, nor is there any attempt at meter. With one or two exceptions they might just as well be written like other prose.</p><p>Of course this does not settle the question. There is a great deal of poetry in the English language without either rhyme or meter. But it is recognized as such in spite of the prosaic form; while Walt Whitman's ebullitions, if put in that form, would not be. Printed as prose they would strike the reader as grandiloquent, sonorous, rhetorical, sometimes as imaginative, almost always as egotistical, but very rarely as poetical. Take, for example, such a verse as the following, strike out the misplaced capitals and the spaces, in short, print it as prose is printed, and see how much of the 'divine afflatus' can be detected in it:</p><p>Sauntering the pavement or riding the country by <br>road, lo, such faces!<br>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity, <br>ideality,<br>The spiritual prescient face, the always welcome <br>common benevolent face.<br>The face of the singing of music,the grand faces <br>of natural lawyers and judges, broad at the <br>back-top.<br>The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the <br>brows, the shaved,blanched faces of ortho-<br>dox citizens.<br>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning <br>artist's face.<br>The ugly face of some beautiful soul,the hand-<br>some, detested or despised face.</p><p>This now is too lamentable a face for a man.<br>Some abject louse asking leave to be,cringing for <br>it,<br>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig <br>to its hole.</p><p>As for the beastly portion of the volume,'The Children of Adam,' it is an outrage upon the decencies of literature. It is open, undisguised sensualism of the grossest sort; and its publication is a grave mistake. We have no special fear that it will corrupt the rising generation, for its indecency is so potent that intelligent parents and guardians will look out for it. But when such a work, with the imprint of a highly respected publishing house, has free circulation and transmission through the mails, an argument almost unanswerable is furnished for the professional perverters of youth whose vile trash, heretofore excluded from the mails, is really less indecorous in form—whatever it may be in spirit—than some portions of 'Leaves of Grass.'</p>",

	"title": "'Walt Whitman's' Leaves of Grass",
	"body": "<p>''Walt Whitman's' Leaves of Grass.' </p><p>This is a republication of the original edition, now nearly twenty years old, restoring all the fleshly matter since expurgated, and having the addition of late songs. It is intended to be the author's full expression to date, and we trust that it is. The book has nearly four hundred pages of close print. The conscientious reading of it and every page of it in the hope that the next line might be different, has consumed two rainy days of leisure. For such time and patience Walt Whitman owes to each reader an unpayable debt.</p><p>The subject of the book is the Body, the Soul, the Sexes, Democracy, New York with its Firemen and Ferries, the Civil War, Lincoln and America—all as revolving in their orbits around Walt Whitman, and cheered in their courses by the sound of what he felicitously calls his 'barbaric yawp.' He holds himself out as the exemplar of a fuller outer and inner life, whom and which no one can hope to understand from his book, or in any way except to go off tramping with him through cities and the wild lands. One object of the book is to inspire the reader with a desire to enlist in this limited and peripatetic army of martyrs.</p><p>Now, it is undeniable that a few of our upper poets have recognized this as the true voice of a seer in the wilderness. It is equally undeniable that this outlandish soul has conceived many large imaginings, and has outlined them frequently in fitting words. No one can fail to see that this tramp has all the faculties and powers necessary for honorable travel through any realm of earth and air. His epithets and describing words are often admirable. His poetic vision is sometimes clear enough to bring new stars of thought 'to swim within the ken.' He suggests no living or dead man except Ossian,1 and him he imitates with a loud voice. Some bits of lofty expression seem to be Ossianic echoes, but there the resemblance ends. Ossian never fell into [illegible]. Whitman rolls delightedly in the mud-bath. Ossian was always perceptible through his wildest flying clouds. Whitman delights in a jar of sounds which have no clear articulation, and affects the pose of the unconditioned and unthinkable Me. The few glimpses of good through his work seem to come from accidental chinks.</p><p>Whitman's obscenity has provoked the condemnation which he delights to invite. It is of a singular kind. He has fewer unspeakable words than Rabelais,2 and perhaps fewer gross ideas than the gentle Montaigne,3 but Rabelais and Montaigne never went beyond the customary limit of their times, nor reveled in their dirt, but only seemed to go through it in process of natural travel. But Whitman, in an age which has excluded some things from print, seizes upon them as his best and most loving expression of an ideal that has nothing beneath it. With him, love is not allowed the delicate withdrawal of anything from the public gaze. There is nothing so personal that it may be kept sacred, or, at least, invisible. The worst coarseness of Rosseau's Confessions4 is produced here. The corruption exposed in this book would 'infect to the North Star.' Worst of all, it is his text and glory, which he seeks to expound as the teacher and personal propagator of a coming race of fine bodies and souls. The new evolution will develop man into the goatish Satyr and woman into the leaping, foaming Bacchanal. This may not be insanity, but if not, it is 'devilish depravity.'</p><p>Time and space would fail to quote fair samples, out of what is quotable of the perverse workings of this man's brain, but a few may be given. Here is a specimen of the uncouth greatness of his imagination:</p><p>Hefts of the moving word at <br>Innocent gambols silently <br>Rising, freshly exuding,<br>Scooting obliquely high and low.</p><p>Here he is in a better mood:</p><p>I see, just see skyward, great cloud-masses,<br>Mournfully slowly they roll, silently swelling <br>and mixing,<br>With, at times, a half-dimm'd sadden'd far-off <br>star<br>Appearing and disappearing.</p><p>He explains his inspiration thus:</p><p>Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to <br>measure itself,<br>It provokes me forever, it says, sarcastically,<br><em>Walt, you contain enough, why don't you let it out <br>then? </em></p><p>He describes himself in this person:</p><p>Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the <br>son, . . . . <br>Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and <br>breeding,<br>No sentimentalist, no stander above men and <br>women or apart from them,<br>No more modest than immodest.</p><p>He explains the limit of his happiness:</p><p>I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and <br>am happy,<br>To touch my person to some one else's<em> is about as <br>much as I can stand.</em></p><p>And he tells whom and why he loves:</p><p>I dote on myself, <em>there is that lot of me</em> and all so <br>luscious.</p><p><em>Ohe! jam satis!</em> What shall be thought of the man and teacher, who, whatever else he has said, has said such stuff as this?</p><p>It is quite natural that the voice of the new evangel of Art, which has abjured reason, should also abjure rhyme. The object of the book is to deify impulse and lawlessness. What is first desired must be right: the fetters of law are unnatural and tyrannical. So the poet sings without rhyme or rhythm. Every line has its own length regardless of all others, as if in this alone lay the odic force. There is none of the gentle scan of sea-waves, but only the chopping swells of cross-seas. But it must be poetry, for every line begins with a capital letter, and the poet declares that it is poetry, having the chief virtue that you cannot understand it until you have got further along and taken a tramp with Walt Whitman. In two or three places he has put himself under the bondage of rhythm and rhyme. Whenever he does this he writes lines that will live—notably, his 'O Captain, my Captain,' inspired by the fall of Lincoln. This is more than a fine poem, and lamentably shows what Whitman might have done had he not been Walt Whitman.</p><p>In this stage of social evolution mankind has passed beyond hearing the mental and spiritual tramps. Banish him to his own desert places, to love and live with his ineffable Me, and to exalt his raucous voice to the limitless Saharas.</p><p>Published by James R. Osgood & Co.

	"title": "The Poetry of the Future",
	"body": "<p>'THE POETRY OF THE FUTURE.' </p><p>Here we have it, the real Simon-pure article, and no doubt about it.∗ At least we are so assured by the author and by his admirers. Let us see wherein the poetry of the future differs from the poetry of the past and the present, and whether it can make good its title to be considered the poetry of the future.</p><p>Walt Whitman is a great poet—in his own estimation, and in that of critics who make up in noise what they lack in numbers. This volume is intended to demonstrate to the world that his claim is well-founded; for, like other great men who have an original message to deliver to the world, he has been misunderstood. He should not complain, however, but remember that obloquy is the ordinary lot of genius. This volume, we repeat, is intended to be his vindication. We have read it carefully and curiously-curiously, because though we had heard much of Whitman before, we confess to dense ignorance of all but a hundred lines or so of his writings—and we do not hesitate to say that it is a volume admirably calculated to convince those who were previously of his opinion. That it will convince others we—but this is to pass judgment before the cause is argued.</p><p><strong>His Moral Tone.</strong></p><p>We should not be true to our own convictions if we neglected to protest, on the very threshold of the subject, against the coarse filthiness of the book. The author is by turns blasphemous and obscene, for the mere sake of showing that he dare do anything and say anything that he chooses. We are not sure that the book is not amenable to the laws against sending obscene literature through the mails; and were the Society for the Suppression of Vice to test the matter, any ordinary jury would give a verdict in its favor. The plea that the book is 'literature' does not excuse such unmitigated and indefensible nastiness as disfigures some of its pages. Byron and Swinburne and Oscar Wilde are as modest as a young maiden by comparison. To write such a book and send it forth to the world with a complacent smirk required great courage—or brazen effrontery—on the part of its author; and it is strange that he should have obtained the imprint for it of so respectable a publishing house. [illegible] </p><p>Walt Whitman's artistic creed is easily understood. He states it on the very first page of this volume:</p><p><em>I too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer <br>and greater one than any, <br>Waged in my book with varying fortune, with <br>flight, advance and retreat, victory deferr'd <br>and wavering, <br>(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the <br>last), the field the world, <br>For life and death, for the Body and for the eter- <br>nal Soul. </em></p><p>That is it, war on the social customs and opinions of the age, on its morals, its religion—on everything. Again he says:</p><p>I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not de-<br>cline to be the poet of wickedness also.</p><p>Decline? He jumps at the chance, and wallows in vice and crime at every opportunity. The poet's friends tell us that his life has been correct, that only in his verse is he a libertine; so much the worse for him, he cannot even plead in extenuation of his offence that he had become so accustomed to evil that it is second nature to him. Deliberate baseness is always worse than the baseness that is the outcome of a depraved and bestial nature.</p><p><strong>Is Walt Whitman a Poet?</strong></p><p>No one will dispute Byron's place in the temple of fame, however severely he may condemn the poet's character and the impress it has left on his work. Walt Whitman may be a poet in spite of his immorality. He asks us to accept him as a poet, as a great poet, with a bold egotism which must be either the height of sublimity or the height of folly. Is he a poet?</p><p>That depends, of course, on what one means by poetry. If by poetry we mean verse composed according to regular rhythmical laws, with or without rhyme, Walt Whitman is not a poet. Regular he never is; rhythmical he is at times, but in a wild and irregular way; and of rhyme he is very sparing, for the most part avoiding it altogether. If there are in this volume six consecutive lines to be found anywhere that will 'scan' perfectly according to any one known metre, it may safely be assumed that they exist wholly by accident, not by the poet's design. He simply happened to express himself in that way. But we do not believe that six such lines are to be found; we have looked diligently, and have not discovered them. To return: if poetry be admitted to be, as to its essence, independent of mere form; if irregular, capricious and rugged rhythmical forms be conceded fittingly to embody poetical thought and constitute a different thing from merely poetical prose; then it will be hard to deny that Walt Whitman is, at infrequent intervals, a true poet. That he is a great poet is a preposterous claim, that is not worth the trouble of serious refutation.</p><p>Let us illustrate. Are the following passages poetry or are they not?</p><p>The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice;<br>Let the multitude of isles be glad.<br>Clouds and darkness are round about him;<br>Righteousness and judgment are the habitation <br>of his throne.<br>A fire goeth before him,<br>And burneth up his enemies round about.<br>His lightnings enlightened the world:<br>The earth saw and trembled;<br>The hills melted like wax at the presence of the <br>Lord,<br>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<br>The heavens declare his righteousness,<br>And all the people see his glory.</p><p>Departed then over the wavy sea<br>The floater, foamy-necked, most like to a bird,<br>Till about an hour of the second day<br>The twisted prow had sailed,<br>That the voyagers saw land, ocean shores shine,<br>Mountains steep, spacious sea-nesses.<br>Then was the sea-sailer<br>At the end of its watery way.</p><p>The first passage is from Psalm 97; the second a faithful translation from Beowulf, one of the oldest and most valuable relics of Anglo-Saxon literature. The Psalms are commonly called poetry, yet they have neither rhyme nor regular rhythm; Beowulf is called poetry, yet it has nothing to distinguish it from prose but a sort of alliteration. If it be admitted that the above are poetry—of a genuine, though perhaps not of the most perfect, sort—Walt Whitman's claim to be a poet is, perhaps, borne out, but his claim to be an original poet is made ridiculous. At the best he has done ill what David did well over three thousand years ago. But admitting that the Psalms are poetry, can we deny the same title to these lines?</p><p>Smile O voluptuous cool breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of the departed sunset—earth of the <br>mountains misty-topt!<br>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon <br>just tinged with blue!<br>Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and <br>clearer for my sake!<br>Far-swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blos- <br>som'd earth!<br>Smile, for your lover comes.</p><p>Whether the thought in the above was really worth the trouble of expressing may be a question, but that it is poetically expressed can there be doubt? And where in all English literature should we look for two more exquisite pictures than these, from a poem on Lincoln's death, 'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed'?</p><p>In the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse <br>near the white-wash'd palings,<br>Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart- <br>shaped leaves of rich green,<br>With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, <br>with the perfume strong I love,<br>With every leaf a miracle—and from this bush <br>in the dooryard,<br>With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>A sprig with its flower I break.<br>. . . . . . .</p><p>Pictures of growing spring and farms and <br>homes.<br>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the <br>gray smoke lucid and bright.<br>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, <br>indolent, sinking sun, burning, expand-<br>ing the air,<br>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and <br>the pale green leaves of the trees prolific,<br>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast <br>of the river, with a wind dapple here and there,<br>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a <br>line against the sky, and shadows,<br>And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, <br>and stacks of chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life and the workshops, <br>and the workmen homeward returning.</p><p>Tennyson never wrote a more dainty love-song than this from 'Sea-drift:'</p><p>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,<br>Day come white, or white come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home.<br>Singing all time, minding no time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Occasionally he is capable of setting a sublime truth in words that are as beautifully fitted for the purpose as the jeweller's fine gold is to receive and hold the diamond; as when he says of the grass:</p><p>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord.<br>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly <br>dropt,<br>Bearing the owner's name someway in the cor-<br>ners, that we may see and remark, and <br>say <em>Whose?</em> </p><p>Or where he says in the same poem, 'I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars.'</p><p><strong>The Other Side of the Question.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, while one is wading through the unnumbered lines of dreary trash in this volume, how often is he tempted to declare that Walt Whitman has not the poet's gift in the slightest measure—that he is only an ignorant American youth whose culture has been gained wholly from the street-corner and the daily newspaper, who has been smitten with a desire for notoriety, and has shrewdly determined that to be odd and singular is the shortest cut to that end. In what respect do his writhings and contortions, his twistings and turnings of our good old English tongue, differ from the affected attitudes and 'intense' dialect of the 'consummately utter' æsthete who gives us so much sport today? After all, does the ability to write a few fine lines constitute one a poet? Does one kernel of wheat in a bushel of chaff warrant us in giving the name 'grain' to the whole? Evidently not, but evidently also, the single kernel of wheat is wheat in spite of the vast preponderance of chaff. May the question not be answered somewhat like this: Walt Whitman is a poet, after a fashion, but he has written very little poetry. If he is not of those who 'die with all their music in them,' as Dr. Holmes sings, he yet may have succeeded in uttering but a small part of the music that is in him. For noise, be it remembered, is not music.</p><p>One further characteristic needs to be touched on in forming a complete and final judgment of the value of Whitman's work. He shows an aptness now and then for coining those</p><p>Jewels five-words-long<br>That on the stretched forefinger of all Time<br>Sparkle forever.</p><p>What could be better, for example, than his description of the sound of the carpenter's plane, as it 'whistles its wild ascending lisp'? Anybody who has ever heard the sound will appreciate the striking fitness of the phrase. 'Far-sprinkled systems' is a most happy epithet for the clear sky of a winter's night; and nothing could better picture in words the thronged thoroughfares of New York than this line:</p><p>When million-footed Manhattan unpent de-<br>scends to her pavements.</p><p>What poet has apostrophized Death more happily than this: 'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet'? And in all the poetry written about the death of President Garfield, has there been a single phrase so peculiarly happy as 'the sobbing of the bells…those heartbeats of a Nation in the night'? But if one shall say of these things, One swallow does not make a summer, nor do a few happy turns of phrase make a poet—for our part we could only assent.</p><p>But, it may be asked, does Walt Whitman never submit to the trammels of poetry, as poetry is ordinarily conceived? Never fully, yet once he comes very near to doing so—in a poem on the death of Lincoln—and this is the result:</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is <br>done,<br>The ship has weather'd every rock, the prize we <br>sought is won,<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people <br>all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel <br>grim and daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>O the bleeding drops of red,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the <br>bells;<br>Rise up—for you the flag is hung—for you the <br>bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for <br>you the shores a-crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager <br>faces turning;<br>Here Captain! dear father!<br>This arm beneath your head!<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale <br>and still,<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will,<br>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage <br>closed and done,<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with <br>object won;<br>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!<br>But I with mournful tread,<br>Walk the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>The most prejudiced will not deny that that is poetry, but Walt Whitman is not half so proud of it himself as he is of some of his 'barbaric yawps.' Nevertheless, he will be known fifty years hence—if he is known then at all, which we more than half-doubt—only as the author of 'My Captain,' on the whole, probably, the most stirring lyric that the civil war produced. Contrast with such a poem lines like these:</p><p>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow <br>flapping, with the myriads of gulls win-<br>tering along the coasts of Florida,<br>[illegible] <br>Otherways, there atwixt the banks of the <br>Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the Nueces,<br>the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring <br>waters laughing and skipping and running.</p><p>Not every writer can drop so quickly and so naturally as he from the level of pure poetry to what is not even prose, but mere drivel.</p><p><strong>A Final Word or Two.</strong></p><p>Walt Whitman is the peculiar product of a peculiar condition of things. He is the 'Bowery Bhoy' in literature, a rowdy with the cacoethes scribendi (in plain English, the itch for writing). He could not have been bred anywhere but in a certain part of New York city a generation ago—in any other place or at another time he could no more have been developed than Plymouth Rocks can be hatched out of cobble-stones. And American letters were in a peculiar transition state when he made his first appearance in print, which fact alone made his career possible. A few devoted admirers have diligently puffed him, and the more judicious critics have ridiculed him into a sort of fame. It is a common saying among publishers that next to very warm praise of a book downright abuse on the part of the critics will best promote its sale. But a popularity thus created is always short-lived; people buy the book for a few weeks just to see whether the critics have told the truth about it, and finding that they have, toss it aside never to look at it again.</p><p>Walt Whitman has certain artistic virtues, it is true; he can paint a pretty pen-picture of nature as it presents itself to the eye, but he has no word for us of 'the still, sad music of humanity' heard throughout nature. How can he tell us what he has never seen—what he has no eyes to see? He has a certain rough power, an aboriginal gift, so to speak, of poetic language, but he is uncouth and barbaric. He has fire, but it destroys oftener than it warms. Though he affects to be as broad as the universe, he is narrow—he has but one note to his pipe, and that a cracked one. Pathos is an element of his power, but it must be allowed that bathos is much more frequent in his writings. As Landor said of Byron, 'there are things in him as strong as poison and original as sin.' He is, after all, too many-sided to be characterized in a single phrase—many-sided in good qualities as well as in evil: At one time he is a dithyrambic Emerson calmly philosophizing on the spiritual truths of the universe; at another he is a prose Swinburne run mad. He is a wicked Tupper; he is an obscene Ossian; he is a poetical Zola; he is—Walt Whitman.</p><p>LEAVES OF GRASS By WALT WHITMAN. 12mo. pp. 382 Boston: J.R. Osgood & Co. 1881. $2. </p>",

	"title": "Whitman, Poet and Seer",
	"body": "<p><strong>WHITMAN, POET AND SEER </strong></p><p><strong>———</strong></p><p><strong>A REVIEW OF HIS LITERARY SCHEME, WORK, AND METHOD. </strong></p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>No writer has been more persistently condemned, and none more persistently and passionately praised, than Walt Whitman has been. He is, we are constantly told, a great poet and a big wind-bag, a profound seer and a boisterous humbug. He disgusts or inspires, he awakens either disdain or devotion. The fine tone of truth has seldom been touched in his case, by even trustworthy critics—although Mr. Stedman has made a temperate and discriminate review of his work. This poet must be, it is insisted, rejected wholly or accepted, and to those who accept him—especially to the young hearts and minds that look straight and sharply to the future—he is an interesting and suggestive personality. It is certainly true that the large reading public, and above all the masses whom Whitman celebrates and extols, have barely an acquaintance or none at all with his books. They have heard of him by way of much acrimonious controversy, and they have perhaps learned by this time that he counts his supporters among some of the liberal and trained minds of Europe. But his public has been, unfortunately, a narrow circle, and his books have not, therefore, been tested after the usual and trying fashion. A chance is now offered to readers who wish to find out for themselves what sort of a poet Whitman is, for his stray writings, collected in a single and convenient book, have just been published, rearranged and edited by the author. This book is the life work, the first and final word, of Walt Whitman. It presents him—or, as he would probably say, his personality—under all possible lights. It brings together, at last, the fractions and outgrowths of his poetic scheme; and it gains thus a harmony and an intellectual completeness which have been heretofore distinctly wanting. If there is clear purpose, and if there is philosophical conception, in Whitman's poems—'ravings' is the word more often said—they should be apparent now. As to his poetic scheme, aside from quality and method of endeavor, that has a breadth and an originality which criticism cannot lessen if it would. Just what this scheme is may be briefly pointed out. Whitman holds himself to be, in the first place, the representative of new forces in society and in nature. He stands for the American democracy, for the unity and supremacy of the mass, for a nationality which may be regarded as the focus and adjustment of all past nationalities, and for a liberty of body and spirit which no other people save the American people has been finally crowned with. So much for his Americanism, which has an inherent meaning and a power, in spite of all that is said to the contrary. The new forces of nature which Whitman represents in his scheme are scientific forces. As Shelley and Hugo have stood forth and sung for revolutionary progress, he stands forth and sings for scientific progress. Others have pictured the future through clamor and fire of struggle; he pictures it through the spiritual and material evolution of man. It is here that Whitman is most personal and original. He is the first poet who has touched nature through close knowledge; the first poet who has suggested amply(?) the law and the harmony of the universe, the first who has looked upon external life as a cosmos. He—the leader of his line—has attempted to express what Henry Sedgwick called 'cosmic emotion.' He has undertaken to grasp the facts of the world and to make these known as poetic facts; to avoid those new literary idealisms and conventionalisms which, to the naturalist and thoughtful observer, are empty child-talk. Poets have written nobly and feelingly of the force and mystery of nature, but always with the slightest possible bulk of learning. Nature is fittingly, truthfully, and powerfully described in the great books of science, not in the songs of the poets. Whitman must have felt this long ago, and he threw himself into the spirit of his century, a century of broad inquiry, keen analysis, and wonderful synthesis. Many of his poems contain the only glimpses to be found in poetry of the real order and meaning of nature. His poetic scheme, therefore, may be rightfully called original.</p><p>Democracy and cosmos—these, then, are the two starting points in Whitman's ambitious undertaking. His ideas radiate from these points. They lead to his views upon humanity, personality, individual freedom, fraternity, and labor; to his notion of the identity of body and spirit; to his theory of chastity and morality; to his idealization of peoples and trades; to the necessity of egotism and charity; to his conception of progress, and to the essential godhead of man. He seeks, perhaps unconsciously, to stand as an idealist and as a realist, to make democracy and men seem what they are not, and to tell plain facts about them at the same time. Toward nature he is, so far as he goes, a realist; because he is always striving to realize the truth—absolutely the scientific truth—of nature. He is, it is plain, an optimist and an egotist of the most pronounced type; for to be these is to arrive, with him, at natural conclusions. His motive as a poet is essentially a manly and straightforward one, however far and wrong of the mark he may occasionally go; for he preaches purity, courage, virility, liberty, and effort. It is one of his doctrines that there is nothing immoral in fact or in act: there is simply immorality of purpose. He believes that there is forgiveness for all sins, and, perhaps, that Walt Whitman is especially designed to define such forgiveness. He believes in the strength and glory and security of humanity, and, by a clear deduction, in the immensity of self. He incarnates humanity in himself, and his mission, in his own eyes, becomes Christ-like. He disdains, of course, the accepted laws of art. He imagines that he can do without these. He constructs, therefore, a language fitted to himself. He stands—so he seems to think—too high for art. Beauty of form may be left to the polishers and piano players; it is not for the prophets and the Whitmans. On the whole, we have here a poet who has frankly tried less to write a book than to find voice for a man. In one of his first poems he exclaims: 'The modern man I sing.' In one of his last he adds: 'Who touches this touches a man.' His text is—and it is a stalwart text: 'I stand in my place, with my own day, here!'</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>It has been shown what Whitman has striven to be and to do. No one could be more in sympathy with what is real and vital in his scheme than the present writer is. But conception is not execution, and Whitman's plans are infinitely better than his work. One should hardly need to be told, in an epoch so critical and so keenly alive to humor as our own, that mere brag and buncombe and assertion do not pass unchallenged as strength; that noise and strain are not power; that extravagance is not inspiration; that orphic talk is not prophecy. It is right, of course, to credit Whitman with sincerity, with the honesty of his convictions. Many are loth to own this much; though no person, minded to learn and see the truth, can read this poet's work through and fail to feel its occasional fire and stir. Whitman writes, at his best, with deep emotion and conviction. He rises at moments to heights of poetic insight and inspiration. There are a fine lyrical sweep and a genuine epic breadth in a few of his poetic rhapsodies. This would be more clearly felt if his work were not so thickly rutted with that insane kind of nonsense which some devoted worshipers persist in calling great thought and great poetry. Whitman's work is like a rich garden embedded in weed. Flower and weed are here inextricably blended. The brag, and assertion, and wrench of this American seer will never be accepted above their value by those who know that the finest art is a result of the finest sifting of thought, intelligence, emotion, and vigor. Art, in a high sense, is the test of strength, not the sign of weakness. In placing himself above art, in confounding the ability to discriminate and shape with mere technical dexterity, Whitman puts himself on the wrong side of nature. This would not be a matter of much moment, it is true, if his clamorous upholders were not seemingly bent upon elevating his method to a doctrine. The poet who labors with no fetters runs to chaos. Nature is like true art in this; it creates within laws. What is more simple and lovely to the sight than a flower? Yet consider the forces that make the flower, the elements that are parts of it, the intricacy of its mechanism; and compare these with the exquisite grace and appropriateness of its outward form. It is a rule in nature that all chaos shall tend to form and harmony; the universe is, when looked at singly, as simple a thing as the cup of a lily. Whitman and writers with his disposition pretend to be the true sight-seers of nature, while they awkwardly reflect its lawlessness and complexity. The harmony and the simplicity of nature are not shown in Whitman's poems, even when these are most true and suggestive. To teach a doctrine of lawlessness, therefore, is about the least intelligent project that his blind followers have tried to carry out.</p><p>Destructive criticism might be applied to Whitman's little understood and much discussed Americanism. There is certainly a thing which may be called Americanism. This is frequently flashed out in these poems, but it is not lucidly expressed. At times it amounts to palpable rigmarole, which no one but a jaded European nurtured amid the tiresome and mournful strife of the Old World could mistake for the real thing. Our country, it may be explained, represents certain new ideas of nationality and advancement. It represents at the present moment, more strikingly and splendidly than any other land under the sun does, scientific progress as opposed to revolutionary progress. It is a land to which all the currents, and longings, and peoples of history move like rivers converging to one stream and one mouth. It is the mother of individual liberty, freedom of thought, and peaceful labor; a land , therefore, in which the researches of the world are most nobly welcomed, which leads the nations toward a righteous justice, which gives a home to all aliens. What progress may do will awaken here, above all, response and sympathy. Our country illustrates, in brief, the advancing spirit of the nineteenth century. This is certain and clear. On the other hand, we are not a people of the old rugged and uncivilized sort. We are not like those for whom Homer sang, and we stand in no need of a Moses nor of a Mohammed. We are not chiefly—as some of the exuberant persons on the other side of the Atlantic seem to think—hewers of wood and drawers of water. Our lasting honor is—and this is certainly overlooked—that our pioneership is above all intellectual. A ripe and vigorous civilization is at the heart of the land. The rabble and the unthinking mob do not represent our real vitality and progress. It should be plain, then, that our country has a peculiar individuality and a decisive mission. It is a strange union of past, present, and future. A poet like Whitman—who rhapsodies more often than he thinks and sings—is sure to suggest something of our individuality and he has, without doubt, gone further than other poets. But his conception of our land and people is full of inexactitude, full of false idealism, and loaded with extravagance. There is too much of the red-shirted Hoosier about it. It comes close at times to the spread-eagleism of our astonishing orators, and to the fraternity of the bar-room. Its permanent merit is that it reflects, after all, something of the free and creative sprit which is the spring-source of our life. It tells us of our liberty—a small matter which our ancestors strove mournfully through hundreds of years to win, and which, now that we have got it, we are apt to prize rather loosely and humorously.</p><p>All that has been written above might be illustrated by columns of extracts from 'Leaves of Grass.' But others may pick these out for themselves. I have simply sought to show broadly that there are radical sins and false premises at the very basis of these poems. Whitman's theory of life and humanity, and his absolute lack of sound artistic instinct and taste, lead him into extravagances which have as much relation to strong and true song as a fishmonger's bawl has to the melody of birds, or to the musical roll of water upon a stretch of shore. They lead him, also, into some monstrous excesses, and the poems comprised in 'Children of Adam' are naked exhibitions of these. The poems in question have been struck by many lances, denounced by many mouths. Good ink has been wasted upon them. They are over-Whitmanish and not beautiful. In these fleshly diatribes the poet sets out to 'make illustrious' that which is not commonly discussed in sensible and good company. He throws off his shirt, so to speak, and cries lustily. 'Behold, I am Walt Whitman, I am moral.' Poets have sung with more or less sense of creation—Whitman goes down to the actual facts. This may be moral. It is intended as an illustration of the highest morality. But it is—unless the world has gone wrong since the beginning of time—indecent and vulgar, not one degree above the loose talk which is, unfortunately, common enough in low places and high. As to its pretentious morality, that does not deceive, and it is solely justified in the poet's inner consciousness. The things here uttered by Whitman may be, unquestionably, thought of chastely, but they cannot be written down and seem either pure or modest. At best, they are coarse commonplace, imposed upon the reader with prophetic earnestness. At worst, they are unlawful exposures of the person.</p><p>It is a relief to turn from this fustian to the 'Song of Myself,' which is a healthy expression of vigorous humanity and imaginative egotism—a poem in which the relation of a man to his fellow-creatures, and to his world, and to the universe, is set forth at moments with real power of manner, breadth of sympathy, and original feeling. The contradictions in this poem are clearly the result of forethought and design, for it is the good and bad in a man, according to Whitman, that awake the unchecked energy of his nature. 'I resist anything better than my own diversity,' he says. And he adds, with rare courage: 'I accept Reality and dare not question it.' There is the right sort of materialism in the following chant:</p><p>'Smile, O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!<br>Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountain's <br>misty topt:<br>Earth of the vitreous form of the fall moon just <br>tinged with blue:<br>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the <br>river:<br>Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and <br>clearer for my sake.<br>Far-swooping elbow'd earth—rich apple-blossom'd <br>earth.<br>Smile, for you lover comes.</p><p>'Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I <br>to you give love.<br>Oh, unspeakable, passionate love!'</p><p>Here is another passage from the same poem, and in the poet's less rhapsodic manner:</p><p>'I think I could turn and live with animals, they <br>are so placid and self-contained.<br>I stand and look at them long and long.</p><p>'They do not sweat and whine about their condi-<br>tion,<br>They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for <br>their sins.<br>They do not make me sick discussing their duty <br>to God.<br>Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with <br>the mania of owning things,<br>Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that <br>lived thousands of years ago.<br>Not one is respectable and unhappy over the <br>whole earth.'</p><p>There is, of course, the usual bulk of orphic and oracular utterance in the 'Song of Myself,' and much of this is solemn commonplace merged into a species of transcendentalism. Its meaning is not always clear. But, on the other hand, the poetry in this song has strength and reach. The following verses were admiringly quoted by Prof. Clifford in his essay on 'Cosmic Emotion:'</p><p>'I open my scuttle at night and see the far- <br>sprinkled systems,<br>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher, <br>edge but the rim of the farthest systems.</p><p>'Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always <br>expanding.<br>Outward and outward and forever outward.</p><p>'My sun has his sun, and round him obediently <br>wheels,<br>He joins with his partners a group of superior <br>circuit,<br>And greater sets follow, making specks of the <br>greatest inside them.</p><p>'There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage,<br>If I, you, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, <br>were this moment reduced back to a pallid <br>float, it would not avail in the long run,<br>We should surely bring up again where we now <br>stand,<br>Ana surely go as much farther, and then farther, <br>and farther.</p><p>'A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of <br>cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or <br>make it impatient,<br>They are but parts, anything is but a part.</p><p>'See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of <br>that.'</p><p>In the 'Song of the Open Road,' 'Song of the Answerer,' 'Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Exposition,' 'Song for Occupations,' and in other poems more or less identical in spirit with these, there is expressed with undoubted sincerity and vigor, entire sympathy with the moods of nature, with the longings and work of mankind, and with the various sides of life. They are singular combinations of triviality, prosiness, poetic feeling, and arrogant personality. They lack, above all, the fine simplicity and clear brevity of songs meant for the popular ear and heart. Yet they have an intensely modern and popular spirit:</p><p>'Away with themes of war! away with war <br>itself!<br>Hence from my shuddering sight to never more <br>return that<br>Show of blacken'd mutilated corpses!<br>That hell unspent and void of blood, fit for wild <br>tigers or for lop-tongued wolves, not reason-<br>ing men,<br>And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,<br>With thy undaunted armies engineering,<br>Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,<br>Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.'</p><p>That is Whitman at his best, free of verbiage and pretension, and with something to say worth saying, with honest emotion and good sense. The same lyrical sincerity is felt in the invocation to America, ('Song of the Exposition,') when he speaks of 'the common indivisible destiny for all.' The 'Song of the Redwood Tree' is throughout a fine poem, full of brain and freedom, and the real hope and faith of our time are simply expressed in the 'Song for Occupations:'</p><p>'The sun and stars that float in the open air,<br>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the <br>drift of them is something grand,<br>I do not know what it is except that it is grand <br>and that it is happiness.'</p><p>There are truth, ardor, and inspiration in some of the songs included in 'Bird of Passage,' the best of these being 'Pioneers, Oh Pioneers,' which has a rugged rhythmic movement uncommon in Whitman's writings, although the opening to the 'Music of the Storm' is equally fine, while some few other passages which have an exceptional quality of sound and rhythm are quickly remarked. The tenderness, pathos, and manhood in the series of poems called 'Drum-taps' are, perhaps, the most natural and sympathetic touches in Whitman's copious and curious work, and it may be said of this work, finally, that Whitman himself marks their surest claim to attention in some of his closing verses:</p><p>'Comrades, this is no book,<br>Who touches this touches a man,<br>(Is it night? are we here together alone?)<br>It is I you hold, and who hold you,<br>I spring from the pages into your arms.'</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The permanent value of these poems, in fact, is to be sought in their two clear merits: in their modernness, breadth, and originality of purpose, and in their presentiment of a strong and fresh individuality. The aim of these poems, and the man behind them, are more distinctive than the poems themselves. 'Who touches this touches a man' is an assertion which is felt to be perfectly just. The book—judged by the standard of all great books—falls far below greatness. There is no single poem in it which could be safely compared with any single great poem in our language. Whitman's work is fine in flashes, in strong passages, or in sudden descriptions. It is weighed down, on the other hand, with extravagances and excesses like those already spoken of, with a mass of ill-digested learning, with long stretches of windy prose, with violent and insecure handling of deep themes, with all kinds of crudity and with a manner which is seldom effective and impressive. This manner has been considerably praised by some for its originality and free musical movement, and it has been called by others a formless manner. But it is surely not formless, since it has a perfectly definite form, deliberately chosen and full of artifice. Its rhythm, however—when it has a rhythm—is perfectly commonplace. The prose of Fénélon and Carlyle and the verse of the Bible have incomparably more poetic color, strength of language, melody and harmony of sound, than Whitman's verse at its best. The laws of natural verse are here ignored, and the result is, of course, unnatural. Compare this verse with the unrhymed movement of Shakespeare and Shelley, with that of Wordsworth's sonnets and Keats's odes, and with the rhythmic freedom of Swinburne's 'Song Before Sunrise;' or compare it with the Biblical verse in the Song of Solomon. As to its utility as a medium for the transparent expression of high thought, compare the most intellectual of Whitman's poems with Tennyson's 'In Memoriam.' These comparisons will serve better than criticism—to persons at least who have ears open to musical sound and minds open to conviction. Language is to the poet what color is to the painter, and great and genuine thoughts should have great and genuine expression. To master language, to garment genius fittingly—this is the art of the poet, and this is the art which Whitman and some others appear to despise. It is art that divides truth and passion from commonplace and rant, that draws a sharp line between sustained strength and hyperbolic bluster. Whitman, however, deserves our deepest gratitude for the stand he has taken, in face of this present age, in the fore of its creative work of reconstruction, in front of its iconoclasm and science. Most of the poets—especially the American poet—are probably against him, but the spirit of our time is not to be quenched by literary conventions, and the strong minds of our time are with him. His courageous appeal for more knowledge and still more might be fitly contrasted with the sentimental snivel of those timid creatures who weep at the passing of the good old days. These sad persons are typified by the æsthetic Mr. Wilde:</p><p>'All romance has flown<br>And men can prophesy about the sun.<br>And lecture on his arrows—how, alone<br>Though a waste void the soulless atoms run,<br>How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,<br>And that no more, 'mid English reeds a Naiad shows <br>her head.</p><p>'Methinks these new Actæons boast too soon<br>That they have spied on beauty: what if we<br>Have analyzed the rainbow, robbed the moon<br>Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,<br>Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope<br>Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a <br>telescope?'</p><p>Those two last lines are worthy of Bunthorne; but they show about as much unconscious humor as most of Bunthorne's contemporaries exhibit when they begin to vent their feelings about romance and science. Weigh such words in the balance with the wise words of Prof. Clifford: 'To some minds there is hope and renewing of youth in the sense that the last word is not yet spoken, that greater mysteries yet lie behind the veil. The prophet himself may say with gladness, 'He that cometh after me shall yet be preferred before me.' But others see in the clearer vision that approaches them the end of all beauty and joy in the earth; because their old feelings are not suited to the new learning they think that learning can stir no feelings at all.' In his article upon 'The Poetry of the Future' (published some months ago in the North American Review,) Whitman wrote these words, which are, I believe, good prophecy: 'Science, having extirpated the old stock fables and superstitions, is clearing a field for verse, for all the arts, and even for romance, a hundred-fold ampler and more wonderful, with the new principles behind. Republicanism advances over the whole world. Liberty, with Law by her side, will one day be paramount—will, at any rate, be the central idea. Then only—for all the splendor and beauty of what has been, or the polish of what is—then only will the true poets appear, and the true poems. Not the satin and patchouly of to-day, not the glorification of the butcheries and words of the past, nor any fight between Deity on one side and somebody else on the other—not Milton, not even Shakespeare's plays, grand as they are.'</p><p>G.

	"body": "<p>LEAVES OF GRASS. </p><p>The animus underlying the songs of Walt Whitman entitled Enfans d'Adam is characteristic of nearly all he has written, and if these had been given their true heading they would have been entitled Enfans de la Bête. Why not? The animal in Walt was free from all conscious restraint, young and lusty, and why should he not sing of its liberties and joys, such as they are? Had not his master proclaimed the precept, 'Act out thyself'? and, having the courage of his convictions, with youthful vigor on his side, the disciple was resolved, in spite of obtrusive advice, to act out fearlessly, at least as far as language and type serve, what was in him.</p><p>Walt Whitman is a more recent and more genuine outcome of transcendentalism. Less tutored, and for that reason—education being what it is—less perverted, he is more a creature of his instincts, and, as it happens, not of the higher sort; and taking his stand on these, he utters himself in accents which at times make the more cultivated transcendentalists hold their breath. Walt is the 'enfant terrible' of transcendentalism. His birth was hailed by the corypheus of this sect with a burst of parental joy; subsequently, on close inspection, he appeared to entertain suspicions of his legitimacy, but now, with maturer examination, his doubts have vanished and he recognizes his lineage.</p><p>The difference between the master and the disciple is this: Mr. Emerson revolted against the false restraints of Calvinism, and, in the righteous indignation of his repressed nature, expressed himself passionately and not seldom unguardedly; while Walt Whitman, unconscious of the impious and paralyzing repression of Puritanism, not having the inherited restraints of seven or eight Puritan ministers wrapt in his skin, takes his master's utterances to the letter and acts them out with all the force of the characteristics of his personality, and in great glee 'sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.'</p><p>Is it a matter for congratulation that the sage of Concord, so-called by his disciples, has not sufficiently recovered from the early strain which was put upon him, seriously to listen in his advanced age to wise misgivings and lawfully-begotten fears?</p><p>But man is a rational animal, and not like the beasts, which have no sense; and all effort on his part to play the irrational beast would be ridiculous, were it not a degradation exacting so great a depravation of his nature. But this attempt is never made with impunity, for man's rational nature sooner or later will surely take revenge on him who makes, whether maliciously or otherwise, the experiment. No, it is not a thing for laughter, but a serious matter, when a man is led to believe that he can with impunity violate any one essential law of his rational being. It is a more serious matter when the leaders of public opinion encourage in a community a belief of this kind, or aid in the spreading of literature infected with such opinions. It is a most serious matter, considering their effect on the coming generation; for the harvest of the poisonous seeds sown in the tender minds of this, will be reaped in the next. And until men gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles every intelligent, every religious, every moral man, every sincere lover of his race, will set his face fixedly against the teachers and upholders of opinions so degrading to man and so pernicious in their tendency.</p><p>Let us have songs of the 'Enfans d'Adam'—not of the old Adam, but the new! Let us have songs of that blissful communion which existed between God and man in the Garden of Eden—communion lost, alas! by the first Adam, but graciously restored by the second Adam. Songs that spring from this source rise upward and imparadise men's hearts! These are the songs men's souls crave, the age hopes for and is ready to receive.</p>",

	"title": "Some Recent Poetry",
	"body": "<p>SOME RECENT POETRY </p><p>[ . . .] 'Strange,' said Mr. Emerson, when he was asked his opinion of 'Leaves of Grass,' 'strange, that a man with the brain of a god should have a snout like a hog.' And the story ran that Mr. Wendell Phillips, turning the pages of the book, remarked, 'Here seem to be all sorts of leaves except fig leaves.' This was in 1855, and as the original edition lies before us to-day we recall vividly the sensation that was made by its appearance. In the first place, it was an original-looking volume, a homespun affair, a thin quarto of ninety-five pages, printed in large type, and bearing on its title-page no name of any publisher, but only the words 'Leaves of Grass. Brooklyn, New York, 1855.' On the reverse the reader was informed that the book had been duly 'Entered according to act of Congress in the year 1855, by Walter Whitman,' etc., etc., and this was the only clew the public had to the name of the author. Not that the public greatly cared to know. The book was not 'published' in the official sense. It was said that the writer of it was a printer by trade, and that he had set up the type and done all the presswork with his own hands. Perhaps he did the binding as well, for that was as primitive as the rest. Yet, though crude looking to the dapper eyes of the trade, there was a rudimentary good taste in the get-up. The title-page would have pleased Guttenberg or Faust, nor would Aldus himself have despised its large and manly aspect. It is parodied in the new issue, but had Walter Whitman had the ordering of this edition he never would have permitted Mr. Osgood to belittle the title-page with his very uncomfortable trade-monogram, which always makes us think of a trichina, though we have no precise notion of how a trichina looks. We may add that the original edition of 'Leaves of Grass' was embellished with the same portrait of the author that adorns the new Boston edition. The prose preface, however, of ten pages, double columns, is omitted, which is a pity, for it is very characteristic of the author, and shows more clearly than the book itself where the author came from intellectually. Mr. Emerson said once of certain philosophers that they had all been milking the same cow—Swedenborg; and Mr. Whitman, as no one who reads his prose preface can doubt, had been for a long time milking the New England transcendentalists. The preface reads like a selection of papers from the Dial. Parts of it remind one of the 'Manuscript Symphony of Dolon,' but the most of it is an echo of Emerson himself, minus his music and his wit.</p><p>The book, however, was misunderstood, as was to have been expected. Mr. Emerson, who had the penetration to see what was fine and original in it, was as wrong in his judgment of one element in it as was Wordsworth in his judgment of 'Wilhelm Meister.' As Mr. Emerson himself reports: 'He proceeded to abuse Goethe's 'Wilhelm Meister' heartily. It was full of all manner of fornication. It was like the crossing of flies in the air. He had never gone farther than the first part; so digusted was he that he threw the book across the room.' In the marble purity of his mind Mr. Emerson was more shocked than he need have been by Mr. Whitman's plain speaking, for that, after all, is all that his much-berated coarseness amounts to. At first he could not see the wood-god for his phallus. Later, he wrote a letter to Whitman, in which he said, 'I greet you at the beginning of a great career.' Whitman showed that he was not quite a god, for he was so tickled with the compliment that he straightway printed it in letters of gold on the back of a new edition of his book. This was a breach of confidence, as Mr. Emerson thought, and he expressed his private indignation at the liberty taken. But what else did he expect? Had he never read Esop?</p><p>Still, whatever may be Mr. Whitman's personal drawbacks, and no writer ever more freely invited the public to an inspection gratis of all his foibles, the fact remains that Mr. Emerson was right in greeting him as he did. If Whitman really does nothing more than enlarge and exaggerate the 'Nature' and the first yolume of 'Essays' of his master, he does it in a way to entitle himself to the award of originality as much as that master is entitled to it. The doctrines of individualism, of personal independence, of the unity of all souls, of the oneness of man with the universe, of the equal birth of good and evil, these are all here as we had heard them sweetly sung or said by the Orphic seer himself, only they were here jumbled, confused, with endless repetition, without art, without taste, without sense of proportion, and absolutely without humor. Here were scorn of the conventions of society by one who never knew them, and who was as ignorant of society as a Digger Indian; the sincerity of cows and dogs and horses, to whom Adam and his wife and the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day were all as one; a primal nakedness of which the author made a great show of not being ashamed, knowing well enough that the logic of his position made shame unreasonable. And all this, with much more, was put forth in good masculine English with farmer-like shrewdness, without mincing of words or phrases; we heard the plain talk of farm-hands and mechanics, of sailors and soldiers, without the fear of women or of dandies before their eyes.</p><p>The new edition of 'Leaves of Grass' has neither the unity nor the expression of the original book. It is not essentially altered in the main part, nor is what coarseness was once there in the least softened or expunged, but it has been gone over too much with the file, rough as it is still left; and all that Whitman has written since the first book appeared is crowded here pell-mell, without order or sequence. It would be a thousand pities were the author judged by the few passages, perhaps not two pages in all, where his frankness pushes him to say things that are really only coarse because they are said. Of indecency, of essential grossness, there is in the book really nothing. It is easy to believe the author as pure-minded, as Incapable of doing or thinking evil, as any best man among us who would blush to be seen in his shirt-sleeves by a woman. All we charge Whitman with on this score is a want of the sense of beauty and proportion, a want of taste, in short, and worst fault of all, an absolute want of humor. He is neither a true American nor a Greek. Were he the former, he would have a sense of humor; were he the latter, he would have a sense of art. But we owe him a just debt for being what he is, and for the much that he has written it would not be easy to repay him with grateful words. He and Emerson are the only poets we have thus far produced; all the rest are imitators, or make-believes, or players upon jewsharps. But Emerson sits far above Whitman by virtue of his noble art, and, little as he has produced, cannot be brought into comparison with his more prolific disciple. The original 'Leaves of Grass' will remain a real contribution to the thought of America, and some of the additional pieces, 'My Captain, O My Captain,' 'Song of the Banner at Daybreak,' 'Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Rocking,' once read can never be forgotten.</p><p>CLARENCE COOK.</p>",

	"title": "Review of Leaves of Grass (1881-82)",
	"body": "<p>The Modern Poet has been found at last. We waited long for him but now he is in the midst of us.</p><p>Sweet smelling of pine leaves and grasses, <br>And blown as a tree through and through<br>By winds of the keen mountain-passes,<br>And tender as sun-smitten dew</p><p>his words have come to us across the Atlantic, and in them the first authentic message from the New World to the Old. Need it be said that we speak of Walt Whitman? We are far from slighting the claims of Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell, and a host of others, but it must be admitted that little or nothing distinctively American has sprung from the best of them. Let us for a moment look at America. The great Western Continent is like a Medea’s cauldron into which along, with the best blood of Europe, Asia and Africa, contributed by annual streams of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, are shredded all the creeds, philosophies, customs and opinions on the face of the earth, Which will find the late of Jason’s uncle, and which of his father, which will be rejuvenated and which will perish out of these mingled traditions French, German, English, Norwegian, Russian, Chinese, in short, of every nation, this is the great problem to be solved, this is the theme which in its entirety no philosopher but Herbert Spencer, no poet but Walt Whitman has ever grappled with. The destinies of our own and of every other country bid fair to be decided in the ultimate outcome of the cauldron, whatever it may be. Is it to be wondered at then that we welcome eagerly the only two men who have seriously set themselves to the task of foreseeing that and telling us frankly as much as they have got foresight of? We now concern ourselves only with the poet, however. His life is as strange as his poetry. At present he is a man of about fifty years of age, still strong and stalwart in spite of a severe stroke of paralysis which prostrated him a year or two ago. He earns his living by the sale of his works, being his own publisher and printer. His leisure is spent in loafing about in a Guernsey shirt and Panama hat among the artizans of Brooklyn and Paumanok and New York, whose society he prefers to any other, but he is accessible to all who want to see him from the highest to the lowest. He seems to have taken up and laid down again a hundred different occupations, having been among other things a pioneer in the backwoods, a tramway conductor in New York, a soldier in the great civil war, a hospital nurse, a newspaper correspondent, and a bookseller. He is said to have written several tales and verses which fell dead from the press before he betook himself to the composition of his great work, his only book indeed, 'Leaves of Grass.' This has employed his whole energy during the last fifteen years. The plan of it enables him to alter and add to it from time to time at his pleasure. The title should speak for itself, yet it may be as well to explain it. Whitman, claiming only to be the poet of common experiences, typifies them naturally under the commonest of common things-grass. Each though is, as it were, a leaf or blade therof which he offers to the reader. But cannot the reader find such thoughts for himself? That is the very conclusion to which the poet would lead him. What then, to enter into particulars, is our author’s subject-matter? The question should rather be, What is not? He sings of all things with the enthusiasm and yet impartiality of nature herself. He is at once the most egotistic and most universal of bards. He invariably speaks in the first person singular but never of the first person singular. It is of you and me and every one, good, bad, and indifferent he talks. He tells us that he loves us and proves it by narrating as parts of his own being our inmost thoughts and feelings, joys and sorrows. Our very crimes he does not shrink from. Sins that we would hide from sun and moon he brings into the glaring light of noonday, but not to condemn—far from it—to shield us, rather, from the world’s scorn by showing them to be natural, and as belonging to himself as much as to anybody. If his book had had a motto it should have been, 'Nihil humani a me alienum puto.' Let it not be supposed that Walt Whitman makes nothing of vice and misery. No one suffers from the sense of them more than he does. But his horror and hatred of sin are always associated with pity and love for the sinner. He regards wickedness—as it should be regarded everywhere—as disease, and nothing more. Had it been so treated for the last thousand years it might have been eradicated from the earth by this time. Whitman celebrates the body equally with the soul (in fact he observes no absolute distinction between the two), and woman equally with man. He carries the doctrine of liberty, equality and fraternity to hitherto undreamed-of issues. He believes in harmonies where theologians catch nothing but discords. Far from looking upon this immeasurable universe as the stakes, as it were, of an eternal game of Whist, in which God and the Soul are partners against the Flesh and the Devil, he takes it to be a field in which all forces on the one side and on the other, contend together in friendly rivalry. He represents Satan as one of the persons of the Godhead. He chants of the Holy Spirit as</p><p>Including all life on earth, touching, including God, including Saviour and Satans,<br>Essence of forms, life of the real identities, permanent, positive,<br>Life of the great round world, the sun and stars, and of man—the general Soul.</p><p>In the deepest sense of the expression , a sense in which Pope, its originator, would never have dared to use it, he believes that 'whatever is, is right,' knowing that in order to [have] one thing being otherwise all the past must have been different throughout infinity and eternity. He accepts and simultaneously rejects every form of religion and philosophy; accepts it as a sufficient embodiment of thought for the times which developed it, but rejects it as inadequate for any other time. He gives us song after song of love and friendship such as have never been sung by mortal man before. He does what no other poet could do—he makes you feel as if, in spite of his never having met you, he were your bosom friend, such as one has dreamt of in school-days, and his words then become sacred to you as a private letter. When we add that our poet tackles astronomy, geology, physiology, chemistry, and in short all the sciences with the same ardour, and that yet he disdains not to sing of the butcher, the baker, and candlestick-maker, the sailor and soldier, and every other individual high or low, beast, man, insect, flower, or stone, we are scarcely sure that we have given even a shadow of an idea of the versatility of genius, and the boundless sympathies and intentions of the man. We recommend our readers to discover as soon as possible how incomplete and inaccurate this notice is by reading Walt Whitman’s volume for themselves. We would as soon attempt to write the topography of the globe as to give a minute description of 'Leaves of Grass.' We have kept to the last a statement, all-important in the case of a Tennyson or a Virgil, but hardly worth mentioning in that of a Walt Whitman, namely, that our author writes in a style neither prose nor verse, the pauses, periods, and rhythms, of which are peculiarly his own. We finish with a quotation.</p><p><em>I DREAMED IN A DREAM</em><br>I dreamed in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth,<br>I dreamed that was the new city of Friends,<br>Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love, it led the rest.<br>It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city<br>And in all their looks and words.</p>",

	"body": "<p>'LEAVES OF GRASS!' </p><p>There are minds which, seeking beauty in all things, tint with their own iridescence of fancy whatever they gaze upon and claim the discovery of beauty where ordinary intelligences can perceive only ugliness, and the nakedness of ugliness! Such a mind seems to be that of the very eminent critic and scholar who not long since contributed an extraordinary eulogium to one of the leading magazines upon Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.' After having read the essay, we sought in vain for those immortal beauties which he discovered in that eccentric, tiresome, flatulent, raw volume of rhapsodies by Walt Whitman, suppressed in Massachusetts. Mr. Whitman has found another publisher in Philadelphia, and a copy bearing the imprint of Rees, Welsh & Co., lies upon our table—entire, priapic, undraped.</p><p>The eminent critic himself, already alluded to, could not, with all his artistic ingenuity, discover any gems of fine thought in the scoriac deposit of that lava-flow of lust, that orgiastic outpouring of coarseness entitled 'Children of Adam.' He certainly did himself the justice to condemn this portion of the work, more or less mildly, to the great annoyance of its creator. Even granting that Walt Whitman has immense genius, lofty sentiment, artistic strength—which we cannot—the 'Children of Adam' would condemn him beyond redemption. Piron was a genius, indeed; but his name will ever be associated with that infamous Ode which befouls his place in literature. </p><p>Yet we would not pretend to judge this portion of Mr. Whitman's work from the standpoint of religious or purely social ethics. In art even that which is highly condemnable by such standards finds indulgence; and perfection of form excuses nudity. There is a holiness about the marble nakedness of an antique goddess that compels respect;—there is a holiness in the passion loveliness creates. The Soul of the Universe is love, permeating, divinizing—finding its loftiest expression in dreams marble-frozen and gem-chiselled—in songs of poets—in the wizard work of musicians—in all the longing of humanity for the Ideal and Impossible. But the duty of art is to elevate our conceptions, to inspire the desire for what is nobler and better than what we have known—to create ideals for future generations to realize—even as Greek mothers brought forth children comely and graceful as the statues of the sculptors. The Naturalists are not artists. They describe only that which is; they are mere dissectors when they are not mere photographers. They acknowledge their work disgusts; and by disgusting people with what is, they hope to inspire them with a thirst for what is not! They are the Nihilists of literature.</p><p>Well, Mr. Whitman is an American Naturalist, quite as reckless as Zola or Maupassant, but withal infinitely less talented, less skillful. The chief difference between the American Naturalist and his ultra-Atlantic brethren, is that he does not profess to revolt his readers for a good purpose—although he does revolt them to no purpose that we can discover. In fact, he imagines that he charms! He describes what is as he conceives it; and seems to imagine himself a great revelator of nature's secrets. There are things which should not be described unless idealized, and therefore only by the high-priests of art. Mr. Whitman imagines himself to be such; and breaks through all canons of good taste, all rules of decency, all conventionalities that the boldest art respects. The result is more or less disgusting;—it is like a navvy trying to model nudities out of mud!</p><p>Pages 86 and 87—('I Sing the Body Electric')—are evidence of this indecency of taste. We do not refer to lasciviousness so much as to coarseness—not to immorality, so much as vulgarity. Swinburne's muse is in some respects more immoral than Mr. Whitman's, but her nudity is of the grand antique sort and her dancing graceful. Her unclad splendor may be judged admiringly, apart from her reputation. But Mr. Whitman's muse is at once indecent and ugly, lascivious and gawky, lubricous and coarse.</p><p>What nobler theme for art than a perfect human body?—the noblest monuments of the world's literatures all contain niches for unclad types of beauty—from the earliest Indian epics to the latest masterpieces of modern verse! But what does Mr. Whitman offer us on these two hideous pages? A series of scenes alternately suggesting a dissecting room and a butcher's shop! He talks about 'naked meat!' What is meat? It is dead flesh!</p><p>Cannibalism?</p><p>And 'jaw-hinges,' 'roof of the mouth,' 'knee-pans,' 'leg-fibre,' 'thin red jellies,' 'lung-sponges,' 'bowels,' 'sweat,' 'scapula,' 'elbow-sockets,' 'the bones and the marrow within the bones'—and many other things which none but Mr. Whitman would mention at all!</p><p>But he tells us these things are the soul! Would it not be more decent to say that he does not believe in individual souls? Is it philosophy even to declare that the 'sweat' and the 'bowels' and 'the toe-joints' are not only parts of the soul, but the soul itself!</p><p>In the downright lubricity of certain lines, we can only say that Mr. Whitman has fully equalled, if not exceeded the extant writers of antiquity, and has used phraseology only to be expected in those surreptitiously circulated works the publication whereof is accounted a crime by the law of all civilized nations.</p><p>He may claim to deal only with legitimate passion; but his treatment of it is illegitimate to the degree of outrage. He has one advantage over his critics, however;—they cannot quote him!</p><p>Elsewhere, there is some philosophy in the book; there are pages of force and rough beauty; there is originality, depth, strong feeling. The book is not the creation of a literary quack. It is the work of an honest man—rude in his conceptions, reckless in his expressions, erroneous occasionally in his deductions, eccentric, erratic, inartistic, enthusiastic, dogmatic likewise. What he writes he believes to be good and beautiful. Some agree with him. We do not. We hold much of his book to be infamous according to the universal code of ethics; and contrary to all just standards of taste; largely shapeless, nebulous—with here and there an appearance of bright and solid nuclei. 'Leaves of Grass' may be preserved awhile by curiosity, like ferns in a mantel-vase;—but they will crumble away, withered by public contempt or indifference, just as soon as curiosity has been satiated.</p>",

Rees Welsh & Co., of Philadelphia, whose advance orders exceeded their first edition, a copy of which is before us. This volume was prepared by J. R. Osgood & Co., with the personal supervision of the 'good, gray poet,' and is the only complete and satisfactory edition of his verse. The question of Whitman's place in literature is too involved and difficult for discussion here; it has been argued by able writers in prominent journals, but with no great decisiveness, and it may be doubted whether critics and critical readers will ever be less at variance in their estimates than now. Whitman has passages and stray poems of such obvious strength and beauty as to compel admiration, but their amount is small compared with the mass of matter written in barbaric scorn of all accepted forms, conventionalities, and proprieties. It is difficult to defend many things in Leaves of Grass, even on the author's ground of their necessity to the completion of his 'artistic purpose,' because to the average mind they are purposeless and brutal.</p><p>The portrait given in this volume is not very satisfactory, though doubtless a good copy of the Walt Whitman of years ago.

Poetry does not require metre, rhythm, or any particular form for its expression; poetry has an unlimited range of all subjects, and the right to treat them in its own way; poetry always has an ulterior and worthly purpose, to which its expression is only a mode of approach; poetry demands of its readers understanding, imagination and fancy.

	"title": "Walt Whitman's Complete Volume",
	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S COMPLETE VOLUME.</strong></p><p>[The publication of Walt Whitman's complete and unexpurgated volume, relinquished by his Boston publishers on account of the objections of the Attorney-General of Massachusetts to certain of its contents, has been undertaken by a Philadelphia publisher. We present, in this connection, some views concerning Whitman's poetry generally, and add some further remarks concerning the propriety of issuing the volume in its present shape.—ED. THE AMERICAN.]</p><p>———</p><p><strong>THE REALISM OF WALT WHITMAN.</strong> </p><p>'IF we look at the matter widely, there is really no such thing as good or bad subjects in poetry, but good or bad poets. Anything, everything, is a fit subject. Art has no business with leading-strings or handcuffs or gags. It says to you, 'Go;' and turns you loose into the great garden of poetry where there is no forbidden fruit.'</p><p>This is Victor Hugo's protest against the disapprobation of those French critics whose conventional imaginations were very much disturbed by the astonishing leaps through time and space that were made by this untrammelled and disorderly genius. It is this same 'quidquid agunt homines,' unrestrained freedom of choice, that Walt Whitman has so urgently insisted upon, when the well-regulated public has remonstrated at what he calls liberty, and society license. If we 'look at the matter widely,' as Hugo recommends, we shall be inclined to agree with the French poet that art should not be handcuffed, and admit as the final test only that the result shall be good poetry; but then this final test must be firmly insisted upon. If a poet has produced really fine poetry, no matter what his material may have been, he has justified himself, at least from the standpoint of his art. But in order to apply this test substantially, we must consider what really good art is; and we find it to be the noble expression of noble ideas; and if it fail in either of these directions it ceases to be the best art. If the ideas are no longer worthy, while the form remains perfect, we have an art that rapidly deteriorates and becomes trivial, and bears within it the germ of decay. If, on the other hand, the ideas are noble and the form indifferent, we have an imperfect, incomplete art, that if it be in a healthy state must soon develop into fuller and finer expression. There is, therefore, not the danger that those concerned with the merely moral side of the question might suppose, in setting art free and cutting her leading strings, as long as the real function of art is recognized. There are plenty of restrictions left, in the severe restraint on hand and eye and speech that true art imposes on her honest servants. What matters it how poor, how mean, how simple the material, if the touch of the artist can turn it to gold, if the imagination can glorify it? There is a certain superb license that brings its own apology with it, when a man of genius is carried over the bounds of convention by the rush of passion, or the glory of beauty, or the heat of a fervid imagination, and is grand at the same time that he is gross, as Shakespeare was sometimes, or Rubens. But if he is only gross without being grand, then there is no quarter for him anywhere, and he is rejected both by morals and art. Realism, for its own sake, has no place in art, least of all in poetry; for poetry, by its very form, separates itself from prose as an imaginative manner of expressing the ideal side of nature and of man's emotions, passions and actions. In prose even brutal realism sometimes justifies itself, when there is need to make reality seem as terribly real as possible and to present facts impressively; but we see to what degradation poetry can be reduced by conscientiously applied realism, even in the hands of a poet of imagination and the most refined sensibilities, a poet who had produced the finest imaginative poetry, in Wordsworth's 'Simon Lee.' And we see to what infinitely lower degradation realism can bring a man without refined sensibilities and a cultivated imagination in Whitman's 'Children of Adam.'</p><p>It is only another proof of the enormous egotism of the man, that he should claim to have made a new departure in insisting on the physical basis of passion, as there is scarcely a poet from Anacreon to Swinburne who has failed to do it ample justice. All that he has done is to tear off, with a rude hand, the thin veil of ideality that 'shadowed its form though not concealed,' and drag it bare before the public, shorn of the finer, higher, purer emotions that sentiment has so intimately associated with it, and stripped of all imaginative charm. This he assuredly has done. It is true that Whitman is a son of the people, and has naturally missed the refining influences of early associations; but then one is forced to remember another son of the people, Robert Burns, and one involuntarily thinks of his</p><p>'O, my Love's like a red, red rose, <br>That's newly sprung in June:<br>O my Love's like a melodie<br>That's sweetly played in tune,'</p><p>when one comes to lines like these,—verses they can scarcely be called:</p><p>'Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturned love.<br>But now I think there is no such thing as unreturned love; the pay is certain <br>one way or another.<br>(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was unreturned,<br>Yet out of my love have I written these songs.)'</p><p>Or put this beside it, so full of spontaneousness and the emotion of the hour.</p><p>'O, wha can prudence think upon,<br>And sic a lassie by him?<br>O, wha can prudence think upon,<br>And sae in love as I am?'</p><p>But it is not only to noble or graceful ideas, but to worthy expression of them as well, that poetry owes its power and charm; and it is in this sense of form that Walt Whitman is so essentially lacking. A poet must be an artist, as well as a man of imagination, and however much of an outlaw or rebel he may be in spirit, must submit himself to the laws of his art. Methods he must have though they be of his own choosing, and the man of genius always recognizes the necessity of such restraints. A poet who absolutely ignores the charm of verse, has missed the secret of his art. An English poet who neglects the language of poetry, which is something set apart from the common terms of daily speech, and by preference employs the most hackneyed, prosaic literal expressions of everyday life, has no sense of the sacredness of poetry. When one thinks of what real poetry is, one has hardly patience with a man who could offer the public lines like these, and call them poetry:</p><p>'I tucked my trowser-ends into my boots, and went and had a good time.'</p><p>'Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well then I contradict myself.<br>(I am large, I contain multitudes.)'</p><p>'I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet besides.'</p><p>'I assert that all fast days were what they must have been,<br>And that they could no-how have been better than what they were,<br>And that to-day is what it must be, and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than what they are.'</p><p>Could indifference of ideas and contempt of form be carried further than this?</p><p>In Whitman's case, it is especially unfortunate that he should have failed to conceive of poetry as an art, for every now and then one comes across a burst of something that might have been poetry, and fine poetry too, if it had been shaped by an artist. There is this from the 'Song of Myself':</p><p>'I am he that walks with the tender and growing night.<br>I call to the earth and the sea half held by the night,<br>Press close, bare-bosomed night—press close, magnetic, nourishing night!<br>Night of the south-winds—night of the large few stars!<br>Still, nodding night—mad, naked summer night.'</p><p>There are passages of this quality scattered through the volume in 'Drum Taps,' 'Sea Drift,' 'From Noon to Starry Night,' but they shine like oases among weary pages that are an inextricable tangle of incoherent emotions, epithets, invectives, detached thoughts, inconsequent reflections, un-analyzable, divigations, that spread in straggling unmetrical lines. The author of Leaves of Grass entirely lacks, or has never cultivated any sustained power of construction, and the fact that he has been taken so seriously in Europe is partly due to his astonishing egotism, his defiant tone and fierce assertion of his own individuality, and partly to the undiscriminating manner that prevails in certain English literary circles to find something that shall be unmistakably typical of the new civilization of the crude Western world, something that might pass for the poetry of the self-made man.</p><p>It is not from an ethical standpoint, not from narrow, conservative prejudice, that Walt Whitman's insistent realism is inevitably condemned, but from the vital principles of his art, which it offends beyond reconciliation. He is judged by a canon that he himself would hardly refuse to accept: 'In poetry, there is no such thing as good or bad subjects, but good or bad poets.' T. FRANCIS GORDON.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass.'

There ever will be a divided opinion, probably, as to Whitman's claim to rank as a poet. Certain is it that he discards all the canonical rules pertaining to composition, and gives just the expression, regardless of 'feet,' that answers his thought's need. Much of his work, therefore, seems but the record of ideas in the baldest of prose. Here and there is a sentiment embodied which touches the highest poetic afflatus. Yet with a feeling throughout that conventional 'poetry' has all been derided, we find many passages that bear reading again and again, and their strength grows upon one as familiarity is achieved. The author seems to us to be laboring with great thoughts, which he must indite at once to rescue from oblivion, with purpose later to set their excellence in flowing rhyme. They are rough diamonds of poetic thought awaiting the inspired lapidary's skill. The 'fleshly' pieces, of which so much has been said, and which endangered the circulation of the book hereabouts, are to our mind but beatific adorations of the great gift of maternity, and to the purist can be as welcome as the nude statue. With the limitations of our civilization, however, there are but few purists, and the intent of the author can easily be misunderstood by very excellent people, and wholly perverted by the depraved. They are not necessary to any representation of the force or originality of the writer, and as they offend large sections of the community, and furnish prurient curiosity with food for lascivious thought, they had better, as Mr. Emerson originally suggested, be curtailed, if not wholly omitted. It is absurd, however, to rank the work as an obscene or reprehensible one in the broad and literal sense.— Philadelphia, Rees Welsh & Co.</p>",

Suppose that any one with brain enough reads this great passage,—remembering that Whitman, in his first person, represents the essential man:—</p><p>It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.</p><p>What is Known I strip away—<br>I launch all men and women forward with me into the <br>Unknown.</p><p>The clock indicates the moment—but what does <br>eternity indicate?</p><p>I am an acme of things accomplished, and I an encloser of things <br>to be.</p><p>My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,<br>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the <br>steps,<br>All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.</p><p>Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,<br>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing—I know I was <br>even there,<br>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the <br>lethargic mist,<br>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid <br>carbon.</p><p>Long I was hugg'd close—long and long.</p><p>Immense have been the preparations for me,<br>Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me.</p><p>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like <br>cheerful boatmen,<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold <br>me.</p><p>For it the nebula cohered to an orb.<br>The long slow strata piled to rest it on;<br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,<br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited <br>it with care.<br>. . . . . . .<br>I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled <br>systems,<br>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge <br>but the rim of the farther systems.<br>Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always <br>expanding,<br>Outward and outward and forever outward.</p><p>There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,<br>If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon <br>their surfaces,<br>Were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would <br>not avail in the long run;<br>We should surely bring up again where we now <br>stand,<br>And surely go as much farther, and then farther and <br>farther.</p><p>A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic <br>leagues, do not hazard the span or make it im-<br>patient;<br>They are but parts, any thing is but a part.</p><p>I know I have the best of time and space, and was <br>never measured and never will be measured.</p><p>I tramp a perpetual journey;<br>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff <br>cut from the woods;<br>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair;—<br>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,<br>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange;<br>But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a <br>knoll,<br>My left hand hooking you round the waist,<br>My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents <br>and the public road.</p><p>Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,<br>You must travel it for yourself.</p><p>This must be read, as it is written, in the grand manner, and the reader who does not realize that his guide casts behind him the centuries and exhorts him to a new lookout into eternity had better read no more. There has been no more magnificent attitude of command taken than Whitman takes in these utterances, and sustains in almost all that he has written. The trivial person has nothing whatever to do with Whitman.</p>",

	"body": "<p>ELMINA.</p><p>———</p><p><strong>Suggestions and Advice to Mothers.</strong></p><p>———</p><p><strong>NO. XIX.</strong></p><p>Written for The Iconoclast.</p><p>To-day my soul is full of the love of the body. 'Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh;' and so to-day, O mothers, I ask you to listen to the wonders and the beauties of the body.</p><p>'For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of <br>years, without one animal or plant,<br>For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily <br>rolled.∗∗∗∗<br>If anything is sacred the human body is sacred,<br>And the glory and sweet of a man is the token <br>of manhood untainted,<br>And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm- <br>fibred body is more beautiful than the <br>most beautiful face.'</p><p>Nurture, cherish and love your bodies, for in them lies the seed of the mind, and on them depends the quality and beauty and strength of the mind. For years and years has this love and worship of the body been growing and developing in the foremost minds of the race. To-day America's new Poet is singing strong, sweet, heart-invigorating songs to his brothers and his sisters. To-day ears are opening, one by one, to these tuneful melodies, and hearts are thrilling in throbbing responses to the echoes of truths so sweet, so simple, and so harmonious, that the wonder is how for all the years past we have let them be sung in vain and unheeded.</p><p>Many are the books I have read and recommended to the world of seekers for knowledge, truth and wisdom; but now I come with one that has but a doubtful fame as the world goes, but one whose words thrill, enthuse, and stir with a responsive echo such as few poets have been enabled to arouse by their works. This wonderful book is 'Leaves of Grass!'</p><p>Be not startled that I—Elmina, the Quaker Infidel—ask you to take into your homes a volume that has been tabooed, ridiculed and condemned by so many. I do it with a full knowledge of its innate worth and purity. Alone here in the early mornings have I sat conning its entrancing pages—rising refreshed and invigorated as from a draught of freshest water from some wild mountain torrent, a new life in every limb, and a new spirit in every thought. Take, O mothers, a page of Walt Whitman for your morning prayer, and you will begin the day with strong, pure aspirations, and a heart attuned to all that is good, true and beautiful—all that is vigorous, natural and elevating.</p><p>'Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and <br>sweet is all that is not my soul.<br>∗∗∗∗∗<br>While they discuss, I am silent and go and <br>bathe and admire myself.<br>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, <br>and of any man hearty and clean.<br>Not an inch, or a particle of an inch is vile, <br>and none shall be less familiar than the <br>rest.'</p><p>I feel that I can not do better justice to the book than to give an extract from a lecture on it delivered by one who has himself the soul of a poet, and the heart of a man who loves his race—George Chainey, the lecturer of Paine Hall.  This one on 'Leaves of Grass' I heard him give myself, while I was in Boston, and it determined me to buy the book; and now I feel that I want every mother in the land to own the volume and love it. To own it and read it will be to love it. I wish I had room to quote all of Chainey's lecture, but a part must suffice.</P><p>'Whitman found that he had to chant the glory of the body as well as that of the soul. To him the two are identical.</p><p>'Behold, the body includes and is the mean-<br>ing, the main concern, and includes and <br>is the soul.<br>Whoever you are, how superb and how divine <br>is your body or any part of it!<br>I believe in the flesh and the appetites.<br>Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each <br>part and tag of me is a miracle.<br>Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy <br>whatever I touch or am touched from.<br>The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than <br>prayer.<br>This head more than churches, bibles, and all <br>the creeds,<br>If I worship any particular thing, it shall be <br>some of the spread of my own body.'</p><p>'In his sight, no part or passion of the body is to be slighted or regarded as vulgar. In doing this, he finds it impossible to leave out of his poems the element of sex. I know of nothing that we need to pay such heed to as to what he has to say on this subject. Never will the world be saved from its sickness, pain, and despair, until we take up this element of human life, and treat it as frankly, purely, and reverently as he has. As he says:</p><p>'Sex contains all.<br>Bodies, souls, meanings, proofs, purities, deli-<br>cacies, results, promulgations.<br>Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal <br>mystery, the seminal milk.<br>All hopes, benefactions, bestowals.<br>All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of <br>the earth,—<br>These are contained in sex as parts of itself, <br>and justifications of itself.'</p><p>'Of course, in the treatment of such a subject there must be expressions used that impure minds will prostitute to impure purposes. The fairest, purest, and most beautiful things on this earth are so violated. As Hamlet said to Ophelia, 'Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.' We all know that depraved passions sometimes break down all the barriers of virtue, and do violence to the most maidenly chastity. It is the same low order of morals that thus seeks to drag into the mire the noblest thought and purest purpose of the best benefactors of humanity. The spirit and purpose of Whitman are clearly revealed in the only reply he has yet made to his maligners and persecutors. He tells us that this subject of sex has hitherto been treated of only in two ways. The first, the conventional one of total repression and silence of good folks, creating the feeling that what can not be spoken of must be vile, and so, by covering over disease and depletion, increasing the world's woe. The second is the coarse, vulgar way of speaking of these things that obtains current in many masculine circles, wherein men lose their respect for women, and hold in low esteem their own manhood through learning to take delight in vulgar stories.</p><p>'Alas! we all know that this is true. Thus, the parlor and the barroom have formed a partnership for the propagation of vice. The first doubt lodged in my mind against the claims of the Christian Church and ministry was the first time I spent an evening in the company of three ministers. I expected innocently that the conversation would be on the subject of religion and touching the advancement of the Church. To my surprise and horror, they spent the whole time in regaling one another with smutty yarns. I never was made to blush so much for the company I found myself in before or since. I soon found, however, that this was quite a common practice in the ministerial profession. At camp-meetings, while one or two of their number are thundering at better men and women than themselves to repent or go to hell, the rest are secluded in their private tent, regaling one another in this fashion.</p><p>'Thinking what he might do to reform these perverted tendencies, Whitman concluded that the time had come for a full and frank statement, in loftiest and most earnest manner, of the relation of sex to the health, sanity, and purity of the human race. He desired to connect it with the highest ethical expression of nature and humanity. How nobly and grandly he has done this, none but those who read and love his poems can feel.'</p><p>I could give you a long array of worthy names indorsing and eulogizing this beautiful work, but instead of the names I give you from the book itself.</p><p>'A child said, What is the grass? fetching it, <br>to me with full hands;<br>How could I answer the child? I do not <br>know what it is any more than he.<br>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, <br>out of hopeful green stuff woven.<br>∗∗∗∗∗<br>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the pro-<br>duced babe of the vegetation.<br>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>And it means, sprouting alike in broad zones <br>and narrow zones,<br>Growing among black folks as among white,<br>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give <br>them the same, I receive them the same.<br>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of <br>graves.<br>Tenderly will I use you, curling grass,<br>It may be you transpire from the breasts of <br>young men;<br>It may be if I had known them I would have <br>loved them;<br>It may be you are from old people, or from <br>offspring taken soon out of their mother's <br>laps;<br>And here you are the mother's laps.'</p><p>I shall be glad to fill orders for this book of books. Grander and purer than all Bibles—a book that shall make lovely women and stalwart men, and sweet, happy, healthful babes.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN.</p><p>In publishing, some fifteen years ago, a volume of selections from the works of Whitman, Mr. Rossetti considered that he was preparing the ground for the ultimate publication in England of a complete edition of the poems of that remarkable, if rather eccentric, writer. That event has now at length taken place (though not, it seems, without unforeseen difficulty of some kind, marked by a long interval between the advertisement and the appearance of the volume, and by a change of publishers apparently at the last moment), and London can at length supply us from its own resources with copies of Leaves of Grass, under which title the author apparently now wishes to include all his poetical works up to the present time.* We are presented at the same time with another work of the same author, the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass (published 1855 in a thin quarto, type set up by the author himself), which is now not easily to be met with. This preface was not reprinted in subsequent editions, but was prefixed with some omissions by Mr. Rossetti to his volume of selections. For what has been given us we must be thankful, though we may mildly complain that Whitman's other prose works, consisting of two books—one a magnificent political prophecy, and the other a personal narrative of deep interest—are apparently to be withheld from the English reader, though long ago advertised as published or to be published in company with the preface afore-mentioned. Even in America, says a personal friend of the author, these books can hardly be said to have been published, though readers occasionally find them out, and certainly in England they are little enough known. The reader at the British Museum may find there a copy of Democratic Vistas, but he will search in vain for Memoranda during the War.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, a real service has been rendered to us by the publication in London of Leaves of Grass, and against the printing of the volume there is nothing to be said; it is, in fact, a fine specimen of typography, with few apparent misprints, excellencies which no doubt are fully appreciated by the author, who knows practically what printing is. For those who are acquainted with previous editions of the poems this publication has an interest of its own quite apart from the fact that it is the first complete English edition. There are poems contained in it which have either never appeared before, or only in a separate form not readily to be obtained in this country, as, for instance, the 'Song of the Exposition,' 'After all not to create only,' with its funeral chant for feudalism, which has passed now to its charnel vault—</p><p>Coffin'd with crown and armour on,<br>Blasoned with Shakespere's purple page<br>And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.</p><p>There are also throughout the poems changes of title, omissions, and corrections, such as the author continually makes in his works, for, rough as they seem and often are, the roughness is not caused by want of revision; and, finally, the poems are rearranged, sometimes under new heads altogether, such as 'Autumn Rivulets,' while 'Passage to India' remains only as the title of a single poem, which in 1872 gave its name to a whole volume. But to mention these in detail, and to estimate the effect of them taken together, would be impossible without assuming in the reader a previous knowledge which in most cases he would not possess. We must confine ourselves at present to more general considerations.</p><p>Whitman has been the object of a good deal of enthusiastic and rather undiscriminating admiration, and also of a certain amount of furious and equally undiscriminating abuse. Neither is deserved, but he lays himself open, it must be said, almost equally to both. It is time, however, that an attempt were made to arrive at a sober estimate of his real value; and to the formation of such an estimate those should contribute who, having carefully considered the writings of the man, feel his influence strongly indeed, as all such will, but are not overpowered by it, and see his great merits plainly without being thereby prevented from seeing plainly also his great excesses and defects. A few of such critics have already essayed the task, but it will hardly be said that there is no room for more.</p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>It is said, and, so far as I know, said truly, that this prophet is not honoured in his own country. This does not mean that his books have not been bought and read: indeed, the number of copies sold of the first editions of Leaves of Grass is to me rather a subject of surprise. Astonishment at the audacity of the venture must have had some share in raising the public interest, for the book unquestionably sold well. Nor does it mean that the merit of the author was quite unrecognized: on the contrary, by some who were most competent to judge, he was estimated at a very high value. 'The most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed' was Emerson's verdict on the book, and Thoreau thought he saw something almost more than human in the personality of the man. But the mass of his countrymen were not and are not strong enough to accept him; they have perhaps too little confidence in their own literary originality to appreciate duly one from among themselves who breaks through all the conventional usages of literature; they have too much squeamish delicacy to admit to their society one who is so brutally outspoken and unrefined. It is necessary perhaps that this writer, for we need not be zealous to claim for him the title of poet, should be first accepted in the Old World before he can be recognised by the New, which at present can see nothing in literature but by reflected light. Strange irony of fate, if such should be the destiny of one who cast off the conventional forms in order to free himself and his country from Old World influences! 'The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.' This he has said and still believes, waiting in confidence for that proof of his title to be forthcoming. But there are many reasons why he should be slowly if at all admitted to his rights, whether in Old World or in New, and to glance at some of these reasons before we proceed further will not be amiss.</p><p>He is perhaps of all writers the most repellent to the reader who glances at him superficially. In the first place he is indecent, and that too not accidentally but on principle. Whatever may be thought of his morality, and that I hold to be essentially sound and healthy, it cannot be denied that in one section of his work, and occasionally throughout the poems and prose, he outrages every ordinary rule of decency. There is nothing impure in this kind of exposure; it has indeed the direct antithesis to prurient suggestion, and the intention of it is unquestionably honest, but from an artistic point of view it is the gravest of faults, it is essentially and irredeemably ugly and repulsive. We are most of us agreed that there is and ought to be a region of reticence, and in to this region the writer had rushed himself and drags us unwillingly after him. He stands convicted of ̓πειροκαλία, if of nothing worse. Akin to this first instance of defect in artistic perception is a second—his use, namely, of words which are either not English or essentially vulgar; and to this must be added a not unfrequent neglect of syntax, which, together with looseness in the application of some words, makes him at times vague or unintelligible. Occasionally there occur words or expressions which, though not ordinarily found in literature, have a native force which justifies them; but generally it is the case that for the French word or for the vulgarism savouring either of the gutter on the one hand or of the Yankee penny-a-liner on the other might be substituted a good English word equally expressive. But here also we too probably have before us a fault of willfulness, for we know that he will not allow the language of English literature to be large enough for the poets of America, but expects accessions to it from Tennessee and California. If, however, he has in his choice of words sought that simplicity which (to quote his own words) is 'the art of art, the glory of expression, and the sunshine of the light of letters,' he has certainly not seldom failed to attain it, and it was hardly to be attained by pouring out indiscriminately into his pages the words which ran naturally off his pen. The 'art of sinking' is illustrated in his juxtaposition of the most incongruous things, and this especially in his well-known catalogues, which, though sometimes picturesque and interesting, are generally only absurd and dull. The fact that they are introduced on principle is not to be admitted as an excuse for the inartistic and formless character, any more than a similar excuse is to be allowed for offences against decency. From many of these faults a sense of humour would have protected him; and this also might have preserved him from some of that violently feeble exaggeration with which he speaks especially of his own countrymen and their institutions, and from the parade with which he sometimes announces truisms, as if they had been just now for the first time discovered by himself. His defence on the general charge is finely given in a poem now published for the first time, written in Platte Cañon, Colorado.</p><p>Spirit that formed this scene,<br>These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,<br>These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,<br>These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked freshness,<br>These formless wild arrays . . .<br>Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten art? . . .<br>But thou that revelest here, spirit that formed this scene,<br>They have remembered thee.</p><p>But the grandeur of nature is not always to be attained by heaping together uncouth masses. We complain not so much that the work lacks polish, as that the writer has not been preserved by his own native genius from ugly excrescences.</p><p>These artistic defects and his general disregard of form make many of his works repulsive, and do not allow us to accept any one as faultless. But they are mostly such as expurgation could remove, and therefore are not vital. The characteristic which cannot be got rid of, and yet repels, is his intense egotism and self-assertion. His longest, and in some respects most important, work—a poem of twelve or fourteen hundred lines, with which the original Leaves of Grass opened—has or had his own name as the title† and his own personality as the subject; and this self-assertion of the individual is perhaps the prevailing characteristic of Whitman's work, that which makes it in fact representative in some degree of the spirit of the age; and the egotism, after all, is not so much personal as typical. The poet is a Kosmos, and contains within himself all unity and all diversity. What he claims for himself he thereby claims for others on the same terms. 'Underneath all, to me is myself, to you yourself.' We feel when the poet proclaims himself 'an acme of things accomplished,' for whose birth all the forces of the universe have been a preparation, he is speaking less for himself individually than for humanity, the humanity of his own day and of future days. The egotism becomes more offensive when it is obviously personal and indicates himself as the Michael Angelo of literature; and that, it must be admitted, is not unseldom, though here too he claims to be speaking less for himself than for the future of democratic poets. To these charges it may be added that, notwithstanding his boasted freedom from the trammels of conventionality, he is in his more ordinary work a mannerist of the most vulgar kind. 'Oh! to realise space!' 'Have you reckoned a thousand acres much?' 'Has any one supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die.' 'I have said that the soul is not more than the body, and I have said that the body is not more than the soul.' 'I swear I think there is nothing but immortality, that the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it!' If these are not all exact quotations, every one will recognise them as genuine types. No style lends itself more readily to parody and burlesque. But when he is at his best the mannerism is in a great measure shaken off.</p><p>The disregard of metrical uniformity is another fact which is observed by the most superficial reader, and probably repels him, but with far less reason than the points above mentioned. It is not indeed correct to say that 'there is no trace of rhyme or metre' in these poems. There is at least one poem which affords an instance of perfectly regular metre and rhyme throughout, and in another the regularity in these respects is all but complete; while in some others, such as 'Pioneers' and the 'Dirge for two Veterans,' though there is no rhyme nor an absolute uniformity in the length of lines, there is a stanzaic uniformity, which satisfies, or almost satisfies, the conventional expectations. As for the rest, some is quite formless; but for the most part there is a strongly marked and characteristic rhythm, not strictly metrical, though with metrical tendencies, nor properly to be called the rhythm of prose. It has rather the monotony of a chant than the varied tones of the best rhythmical prose, though it must be said that it not only resembles but is identical with the early prose rhythm of the same author.‡ Every reader of the preface before us will perceive this; and we are relieved from the possibility of doubt by the fact that passages from this preface have been introduced word for word, or with insignificant changes, into subsequently published poems, being divided stichometrically into lines by the natural pauses of the sentence. The words which he himself uttered in this preface on the subject of the rhythmical uniformity are among the best which have been spoken on that subject yet, and no apology is needed for quoting them.</p><p>The poetic quality is not marshalled in rhyme or uniformity. . . . but is the life of these and much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme and the uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of material laws, and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a bush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts, and oranges, and melons, and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems, or music, or orations, or recitations are not independent but dependent. . . . Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost.</p><p>It has been said already that though Whitman's lines are not ordinarily metrical, yet they have metrical tendencies, and this will readily be perceived by any one who reads them aloud. The prevailing rhythm is dactylic. Every reader of Whitman will recognise as characteristic the following examples, chosen purely to illustrate the movement:—</p><p>Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;<br>When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side that day,<br>One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall never forget;<br>One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,<br>Then onward I sped in the battle. . . .</p><p>Or again—</p><p>It is well—against such I say not a word, I am their poet also;<br>But behold such swiftly subside, burnt up for Religion's sake;<br>For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the earth,<br>Any more than such are to Religion.</p><p>Not unseldom we find regular or slightly irregular hexameters, sometimes several in succession, and occasionally also pentameters, e.g.—</p><p>Do you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded?</p><p>Or,</p><p>Borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierced with missiles I saw them,<br>And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody.</p><p>Or again (an elegiac couplet)—</p><p>Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence equidistant<br>Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.</p><p>But these are accidents. Let me call the reader's attention to one form of this rhythm which is doubtless the result of design, the occasional lengthening of line in passionate lyrical outbursts, which produces sometimes a remarkable effect of intensity in that it 'crowds and hurries and precipitates' the notes in the eagerness as it were of the verse to find a cadence.</p><p>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would.</p><p>From these dactylics we pass to the inspiriting trochaics of 'Pioneers,' and finally, as the poet grows graver in the more deeply spiritual songs of the soul and of death, which are among his last productions, with the rapid flow of the earlier rhythm mingles the graver tone of the iambic, as in the remarkable poem called 'Passage to India.'</p><p>Passage indeed, O soul, to primal thought,<br>Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,<br>The young maturity of brood and bloom,<br>To realms of budding bibles.</p><p>Or again, in the still more recent 'Song of the Redwood Tree'—</p><p>Nor yield we mournfully, majestic brothers,<br>We who have grandly filled our time;<br>With nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight,<br>We welcome what we wrought for through the past,<br>And leave the field for them.</p><p>But enough of the outward form; it is time that we examine more closely the value of the contents.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>If we were asked for justification of the high estimate of this poet, which has been implied, if not expressed, in what has been hitherto said, the answer would be perhaps first, that he has a power of passionate expression, of strong and simple utterance of the deepest tones of grief, which is almost or altogether without its counterpart in the world. Not often has he exerted his power, but often enough to let us understand that he possesses it, and to stamp him as a poet inferior to few, if any, of our time in strength of native genius, however he may fall behind many in artistic perception. Two poems of death, indicated often by himself as the highest theme, though not faultless, for none of his work is so, are enough in themselves to rest his claim upon. The first is 'Out of the Cradle endlessly rocking;' and the other that funeral hymn for President Lincoln which begins, 'When Lilacs last in the Door-yard bloomed.' Nothing illustrates more strongly than these two poems the intense sympathy of the writer with nature, animate and inanimate, and the deep emotional significance which it has for him. Both are saturated with influences of sky, sea, or forest. The first is of the ocean, whose husky meaning is a fit accompaniment to the song of desolate loneliness; the second is of the forest, whose pine-fragrance is as the perfume of the sweet soul that is gone. In both the most passionate outpourings come forth in the notes of birds—the mocking-bird, the most magnificent of songsters, and the hermit thrush, the grey-brown minstrel of the cedar swamp, lyrical mourners whose chant is fused and translated into words by the ecstatic listener. Shelley's skylark pours forth a harmonious madness of joy, Keats' nightingale seems to be intoxicated with passionate yearning; but never before has a bird poured forth to a poet a song so capable of stirring the depths of emotion in the heart, as heart-breaking indeed in its intensity of grief, as that of the lone singer 'on the prong of a moss-scalloped stake, down almost among the slapping waves.' The burden of the first division of the chant is 'Two together.'</p><p>Shine! shine! shine!<br>Pour down your warmth, great sun!<br>While we bask, we two together.<br>Two together!<br>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,<br>Day come white or night come black,<br>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,<br>Singing all time, minding no time,<br>While we two keep together.</p><p>Such is the joyous and careless song of the two feathered guests on the seashore of Paumánok, when the snows had melted and the lilac scent was in the air, while every day the boy, curious but never disturbing them, peered cautiously at the he-bird flitting to and fro, and the she-bird 'crouch'd on her nest, silent with bright eyes,' till on a sudden, 'may-be killed unknown to her mate,' she disappeared, nor returned that day nor the next, nor ever appeared again. And thenceforward all the summer, day and night over the surging of the fierce mother the sea, the boy hears at intervals the solitary one who is left.</p><p>Blow! blow! blow!<br>Blow up, sea winds, along Paumánok's shore,<br>I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.</p><p>Often the child, gliding down to the beach, had stood with bare feet, the wind wafting his hair, with 'the white arms out in the breaker tirelessly tossing,' to listen and translate the notes of the demon or bird.</p><p>Soothe! soothe! soothe!<br>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,<br>And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every one close,<br>But my love soothes not me, not me.<br>Low hangs the moon, it rose late,<br>It is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.<br>O madly the sea pushes upon the land,<br>With love, with love.<br>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?<br>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?<br>Loud! loud! loud!<br>Loud I call to you, my love!<br>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves.<br>Surely you must know who is here, is here,<br>You must know who I am, my love.<br>Low-hanging moon!<br>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?<br>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!<br>O moon, do not keep her from me any longer.<br>Land! land, O land!<br>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again, if you only would,<br>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</p><p>———</p><p>But soft! sink low!<br>Soft! let me just murmur,<br>And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea,<br>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,<br>So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,<br>But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.<br>Hither, my love!<br>Here I am! here!<br>With this just-sustained note I announce myself to you,<br>This gentle call is for you, my love, for you.<br>Do not be decoyed elsewhere,<br>That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice;<br>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;<br>Those are the shadows of the leaves.<br>O darkness! O in vain!<br>O I am very sick and sorrowful.</p><p>———</p><p>O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!<br>In the air, in the woods, over fields,<br>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!<br>But my mate no more, no more with me!<br>We two together no more.</p><p>It stirs the boy's heart, and he feels that it is toward him and not really toward its mate that the bird sings, and a thousand echoes have started to life in his soul.</p><p>O give me the clew! (It lurks in the night here somewhere),<br>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!<br>Whereto answering, the sea,<br>Delaying not, hurrying not,<br>Whispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,<br>Lisped to me the low and delicious word death,<br>And again death, death, death, death,<br>Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart,<br>But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,<br>Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,<br>Death, death, death, death, death.</p><p>This is the only solution of the cries of unsatisfied love, and here lies the highest problem which awaits the poet always with its unconquerable, almost unassailable, mysteriousness. This word it is which he gives as the key to the thousand responsive songs awakened in him from that hour, the word which the sea whispered, 'like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside.'§ 'Whispers of Heavenly Death' is the title of one section of these poems, and it is the 'Carol of Death' which forms the centre of the second of the two poems to which attention has not been called. Splendidly imaginative is this 'nocturne,' with its three ever-recurring chords, 'lilac, and star, and bird.' Of more intricate construction than the other and less directly passionate, because expressive of a more reflecting sorrow, it is yet a composition which few can read or hear unmoved.</p><p>Ever-returning Spring, trinity sure to me you bring,<br>Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,<br>And thought of him I love.</p><p>The star is disappearing in the black murk of clouds, while cruel hands hold him powerless; but his senses are steeped in the perfume of the lilac and the song from secluded recesses, 'death's outlet song of life,' of the singer among the cedars, while 'over the breast of the spring,' through lanes and through streets of cities,</p><p>Passing the yellowspear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark brown fields uprisen,<br>Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the orchards,<br>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,<br>Night and day journeys a coffin.<br><p>To the coffin that slowly passes, with the great cloud darkening the land, with the people's mourning and 'the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,' he brings a sprig with its flower broken from the lilac bush, with its delicate blossoms and heart-shaped leaves. Nor for this coffin alone, but for all he would bring blossoms and branches and chant a song 'for you, O sane and sacred Death.' This, after all, was what the great star must have meant a month since—</p><p>As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night,<br>As you drooped from the sky low down as if to my side, while the other stars all look'd on,<br>As we wander'd together the solemn night (for something, I know not what, kept me from sleep).</p><p>But he is drawn by the song of the bird, though for a moment he lingers, detained by the star, his departing comrade, and by the mastering odour of the lilac. Sea winds blown from east and west, from the Atlantic and from the Pacific, shall be the perfume for the grave of the man he loves. Pictures of growing spring 'with flood of the yellow gold of the gorgeous indolent sinking sun,' of all the scenes of life in country or city of this varied and ample land, these shall adorn his burial house. But over all these falls the dark cloud,</p><p>And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.<br>Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,<br>And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,<br>And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,<br>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,<br>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,<br>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.</p><p>The bird sang the 'Carol of Death.'</p><p>Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.</p><p>The hearer stands rapt by the charm and holding as if by the hand his mystic companions, while the sight that was bound in his eyes 'unclosed, as to long panoramas of visions.' He sees the vision of armies, of battle flags borne through the smoke, of the corpses of all the slain soldiers of the war, and he sees that they were not as had been thought.</p><p>They themselves were fully at rest, they suffered not;<br>The living remained and suffer'd.</p><p>Passing from the visions and from the song, he unlooses the hold of his comrades' hands, and leaves the cedars and the lilac with heart-shaped leaves; yet each and all he keeps.</p><p>The song, the wondrous chant of the grey-brown bird,<br>And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,<br>With the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe,<br>With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,<br>Comrades mine, and I in the midst, and their memory ever I keep, for the dead I loved so well,<br>For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands—and this for his dear sake,<br>Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,<br>There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The passage from the region of pure imagination and passion to the other works of the same writer compels us to deal with his religious and political philosophy. In religion, if he is to be labelled with a name, it must be perhaps 'Pantheist;' he is an exponent of 'Cosmic Emotion.' 'I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand not God in the least.' It is the contemplation of 'the fathomless universe,' and all its movements and rests, its organic and inorganic existences, which stirs the religious emotion in his soul. Men are inclined to cry, 'What is this separate nature so unnatural? What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth without a throb to answer ours, cold earth, the place of graves).' To answer this question is the function of the poet, to soothe 'the sad incessant refrain, Wherefore, unsatisfied soul? and Whither, O mocking Life?' His answer is, 'Bathe in the Spirit of the Universe, intoxicate thyself with God.'</p><p>Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time, and Space, and Death, like waters flowing,<br>Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,<br>Whose air I breathe, whose ripples bear, lave me all over,<br>Bathe me, O God, in thee, mounting to thee,<br>I and my soul to range in range of thee,<br>O Thou transcendent,<br>Nameless, the fibre and the breath,<br>Light of the light, shedding forth universes. . . .<br>Thou pulse, thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,<br>That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,<br>Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,<br>How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak, if out of myself<br>I could not launch to those superior universes?</p><p>God, as he includes all, includes personality, and from God will come somehow a satisfaction of the longing of the soul. What conclusions, if any, are to be drawn from the alteration in the new edition of the poem called 'Gods,' I leave it to the curious to consider; but in it clearly, as elsewhere, we find anticipation of the</p><p>Lover divine, and perfect comrade,<br>Waiting content, invisible yet, but certain,</p><p>of whom, whether he be ideal or real, we cannot pronounce.</p><p>About immortality he doubts, yet strongly believes. In moments of cool reflection he feels that the questions of 'identity beyond the grave' is the great unsolved problem. Yet his poetical optimism continually leads him to assert immortality, and that not merely the merging of our life in the vital forces of the universe, though that is sometimes his meaning, but actual personal identity of the human soul after death. We have, on the one hand, among his first utterances—</p><p>I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love;</p><p>and, on the other hand, we have later the picture of the chamber of death, where</p><p>The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks curiously on the corpse;</p><p>and again the cry—</p><p>If maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are betrayed,<br>Then indeed suspicion of death.</p><p>On the whole he seems to become more definite as he proceeds, in his anticipation of 'identity after the grave.' As for defined creeds, it is not they which give the life;</p><p>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they are shed out of you.</p><p>God and the soul are not to be argued about;</p><p>Logic and sermons never convinces;<br>The damp of the night strikes deeper into my soul.</p><p>But religion is the thing above all, and he rarely fails to point the way to spiritual meanings.</p><p>His morality is almost comprised in the one word 'health,' health of body and health of soul, the healthy and sane man to be the ultimate standard. These are Greek ethics, and the maxim on which they seem to be based—</p><p>Whatever tastes sweet to the most perfect person, that is finally right—</p><p>is thoroughly Aristotelian. A 'sane sensuality,' as it is called by one of his friends, is a necessary part of the ideal man. The body is sacred as well as the soul, and to assert is sacredness is the purpose of his sometimes outrageous physiological details, which can hardly have the desired effect, but are clearly not meant, nor indeed adapted, to minister to vicious tastes; they may disgust, but they can hardly corrupt. There is indeed something in this tearing away of veils which, however justly it may offend true modesty, is to unhealthiness and pruriency as sunlight and the open air; they shrink from the exposure, and shiver at the healthy freshness; it is not an atmosphere in which they can long survive: mystery is the region in which they thrive, and here all mystery is rudely laid bare. This man's nature is itself as healthy as the sea, which endangers not us with all the fevers deposited in it.</p><p>His judgment of actions is rather aesthetic than strictly moral, and he admires the unconscious blossoming out of good and kindly deeds more than all the moral struggles which proceed from religious introspection. He envies the careless rectitude of the movements of animals who are placid and self-contained, and do not 'sweat and whine about their condition.' He is sure that good deeds have their happiness in themselves and not in any external or future reward, and that bad deeds have their misery in themselves and not in any external or future punishment.</p><p>The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him;<br>The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him;<br>The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him;<br>The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him;<br>The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him, it cannot fail.</p><p>And again of a future life—</p><p>I have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us changed;<br>I have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and past law,<br>And that murderers, drunkards, and liars shall be under the present and past law,<br>For I have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough.</p><p>But underlying all, so far as he himself is concerned, is a sympathy embracing all human beings, however vile, and all animals and plants, however irresponsive. It is this which leads him at times to emphasise his own sensuality, that he may make himself the equal of the most depraved, to draw them if it may be in the bonds of sympathy to himself. It is this which is the open secret of that magnetic influence which he is said to exercise over those whom he casually meets. It was this which led him to the hospitals rather than to the field of battle, and makes him recall in memory now the experiences of the 'Dresser,' rather than the great battles and sieges at which he was present. No study of the poet would be complete which did not include the section of his work which deals with the war and after, which indeed contains some of the most magnificent and spirit-stirring trumpet-blasts, as well as some of the most deeply-moving aspects of suffering and death ever expressed by poet. Here was a great theme, and he treated it nobly; with all notes of patriotism and devotion to the flag is beautifully blended sympathy for the vanquished, and deep desire to relieve the sufferings of the wounded. On the whole no part of his work is more interesting than this; it is as if he were the born poet of emancipation, tender to all suffering persons, yet with nerve strong enough to endure without fainting or shrieking the stroke of necessary surgery. Magnificent is his war cry, as in the 'Song of the Banner at Daybreak,' and his note of triumph, 'The war is completed, the price is paid, the title settled beyond recall;' yet finer still is the 'Vigil on the Field of Battle,' the memories of the hospital tent with its long row of cots, the vision of the Mother of All gazing desperate on her dead, the reflection on those 'Camps of Green' where friend and foe without hatred sleep, and need not any longer provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign, nor drummer to beat the morning drum. Other things, too, he gathered from the experiences of the war: he gathered from them more than from all else the steadfastness of his belief in democracy, in the nobleness and courage of common men. But to speak of this would belong rather to a review of the Democratic Vistas, which is not my task; the poetical aspects of the theme are enough. The poet then believes in the power of sympathy, but he believes also in individuality 'underneath all—individuals.' At least half his work is devoted to the assertion of this, and yet with this sympathy and 'adhesiveness' is to go hand in hand, and he has as his watchword still the word of democracy, the word En-masse. The reconciliation is to be found in the prose more clearly than in the verse, but Whitman is not over-anxious for reconciliation; he is large, he contains multitudes, and has room for contradictions.</p><p>Do I contradict myself?<br>Very well then, I contradict myself.</p><p>That being so, his optimism is the more comprehensible; and it is upon a basis of optimism after all that he builds his whole religion and philosophy. He has too firm a grasp of fact to ignore the existence of evil. If he exclaims at times, 'There is no evil,' he adds, 'or if there is, it is just as important to you as anything else.' 'I am not the poet of goodness only; I am just as much the poet of evil.' But he believes that evil is transient and relative; he holds that the drift of things is towards good; that all is, not at once, but finally for the best. This he said, in plain prose, is the growing conviction of his life, and in verse, of the souls of men and women going forward along the roads of the universe,</p><p>They go, they go, I know that they go, but I know not where they go,<br>But I know that they go forward toward the best.</p><p>This it is which makes him so much at peace about God and about death. 'No array of words can describe how much I am at peace about God and about death;' the heroic failures of this world are to him eternal successes. 'Battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won;' therefore, 'Vivas to those who have failed!' And above all the cause of liberty will finally succeed.</p><p>Revolt! and still revolt! revolt!</p><p>———</p><p>When liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go nor the second or third to go,<br>It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.<br>When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,<br>And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth,<br>Then only shall liberty, or the idea of liberty, be discharged from that part of the earth,<br>And the infidel come into full possession.</p><p>Too much, perhaps, has been said of the religion and morality of the poet, and too little of the literary aspect of his works. But this it is difficult to illustrate sufficiently by quotation, and impossible to set forth without illustration. It seemed to me that suggestions of the drift of the whole were more likely to be useful than attention to particular points. Everyone will remark first the too frequent infelicity of sentiment and phrase, and then the striking directness of utterance, and the stumbling, as if by accident, on the absolutely best words in the absolutely best order, which characterises his finest work. Whether these be truly poems, or fine imaginings only, we need not be much concerned to inquire. His own claim to be the poet of America is based on other than purely literary grounds.</p><p>Give me the pay I have served for,<br>Give me to sing the songs of the great Idea, take all the rest.<br>I have loved the earth, sun, animals; I have despised riches;<br>I have given alms to everyone that asked….<br>I have dismissed whatever insulted my own soul or defiled me body,<br>Claimed nothing to myself which I have not carefully claimed for others on the same terms,<br>Sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every state,<br>(Upon this breast has many a dying soldier leaned to breathe his last).</p><p>———</p><p>Say, O mother, have I not to your thought been faithful?<br>Have I not through life kept you and yours before me?</p><p>G.C.

BUCKE, M.D. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>IN a letter dated Concord, 6th May, 1856, Emerson wrote to Carlyle:—'One book, last summer, came out in New York, a nondescript monster which yet has terrible eyes and buffalo strength, and was indisputably American, which I thought to send you, but the book throve so badly with the few to whom I shewed it, and wanted good morals so much, that I never dxml:id. Yet I believe now again I shall. It is called Leaves of Grass, was written and printed by a journeyman printer in Brooklyn, New York, named Walter Whitman; and after you have looked into it, if you think, as you may, that it is only an auctioneer's inventory, you can light your pipe with it.'</p><p>The book referred to was a copy of the singular looking thin quarto volume of little more than a hundred pages, in which the Leaves of Grass originally appeared, and which is now so eagerly sought after by American book-collectors. What Carlyle's opinion of it was, whether, as Emerson thought he might, he used it for the purpose of lighting his pipe, or like Emerson, he held it in high esteem for its intrinsic excellence, we have no means of knowing. In the recently published Carlyle-Emerson correspondence there is no further reference to it, and so far as we can remember, no allusion is made to it in any of Carlyle's published writing.</p><p>The reception which this strange 'nondescript monster['] with 'terrible eyes and buffalo strength' met with at the hands of the public and in literary circles was almost as disheartening as possible. Of the thousand copies printed, some, Dr. Bucke informs us, were given away, most of them were lost, abandoned, or destroyed.∗ According to Mr. Burroughs, some sixty copies were deposited for sale in a bookseller's shop in Brooklyn, and as many more in another in New York. Weeks elapsed and not a single copy was sold. Presently there came the request from both the booksellers that the unfortunate thin quarto should be removed. Subsequently the copies found refuge in the warehouse of a phrenological publishing establishment in Broadway, the proprietors of which advertised the work, and sent out copies for review and to distinguished persons. 'The journals,' continues Mr. Burroughs, 'remained silent, and of the copies sent to distinguished persons several were returned with insulting notes. The only reception heard of, was such, for instance, as the use of the volume by the attaches of a leading daily paper in New York—collected in a swarm Saturday afternoon, waiting to be paxml:id off—as a butt and burlesque, whose perusal aloud by one of the party, the other lounging or standing about, was equivalent to peals upon peals of ironical laughter from the whole assemblage.† Cold as its reception by the press was, it was scarcely so silent, however, as Mr. Burroughs' words might lead the reader to suppose. As we learn from Dr. Bucke's extremely useful and handy little volume, it was noticed, though certainly in no very complimentary terms, in the Brooklyn Daily Times, in the London Critic, and in the New York Criterion. Nor was it altogether ignored in higher quarters. It had the honour of being reviewed in Putnam's Magazine, then the most influential and best conducted of the American periodicals. The reception given to it there was probably under the circumstances the best possible. The reviewer filled three columns with extracts from its pages, selecting the most original and striking passages, and passing over those which were calculated to offend, and though he pronounced the new poems to be a 'mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism,' which were here 'seen to combine in harmony,' and indulged in other pleasantries of a similar nature, he frankly acknowledged that there were to be found 'an original perception of nature, a manly temper, and an epic directness in the new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school.'</p><p>That any warmer or more encouraging reception should have been accorded to the book was scarcely to be expected. Its singular appearance, its peculiar lines, its utter want of conformity with most of the conventionalities of the poet's art, the obscurity of its author, and above all its seeming want of good morals were against it. Circumstances, however, soon conspired to lift both the volume and its author, if not out of derision, at least out of obscurity. The first and most weighty was the publication of a letter to Whitman from Emerson in which he declared the Leaves of Grass a 'wonderful gift,' and pronounced it 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' 'I give you joy,' he wrote with his usual cheeriness, 'of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things saxml:id incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.    .   .   .  The solxml:id sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Thoreau wrote of the book in a similar, if more guarded, strain. 'On the whole, it sounds to me,' were his words, 'very brave and American, after whatever deductions. I do not believe that all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in this land, put together, are equal to it for preaching. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He sometimes suggests something a little more than human.' By these and other means public attention was gradually directed to the volume: and when at length a new and enlarged edition appeared in 1856, it awoke a perfect storm of derision and abuse. Indeed, so extreme were the feelings it excited, that, according to Dr. Bucke, a number of persons in New York seriously contemplated instituting proceedings against its author in the courts of law, and were only deterred by the consxml:ideration that, whatever might be the estimation in which his book deserved to be held, Whitman himself was so popular in New York and Brooklyn that it would be impossible to get a jury to find him guilty. But the best piece of good luck that befell Whitman was his dismissal in 1865, by Mr. Harlan, formerly a Wesleyan clergyman, but at the time secretary for the Interior, from a government clerkship he had obtained, on the ground of the alleged immorality of Leaves of Grass. This act at once put the climax to the discussion as to his merits and demerits, and aroused an intense curiosity respecting his volume, and not a little sympathy in his favour.</p><p>On Whitman himself the derision and abuse, which were heaped upon him in true Philistine fashion, had, and have had, little or no permanent effect. Least of all, have they induced him to modify the principles with which he started on his literary career, which, as Emerson rightly divined, 'had a long foreground.' Having carefully settled his principles at the beginning, Whitman has steadily adhered to them, never doubting, and never having the slightest misgivings as to their soundness. Respecting the matter in which he has applied them—a very different thing—he has now and again had serious doubts.</p><p>'Since I have been ill,' he writes in a note to the Preface of 1876, 'I have felt temporary depression more than once, for fear that in Leaves of Grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced.' But in his clearest and calmest moods he has always realized, he tells us, that as the Leaves surely prepare the way for morals and necessitate them, and are adjusted to them just as nature does and is, so they are what, consistently with his plan, they must and should be. The scorn which he naturally felt towards his detractors was mainly of the silent sort. He neither sought to defend his reputation, nor to retaliate on those by whom it was so savagely assailed; nor dxml:id he care much whether he was understood or not. In a poem which does not seem to have been included in the earliest edition, and which is in some respects characteristic, he writes:—</p><p>'I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or to be understood;<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise;<br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all),</p><p>'I exist as I am—that is enough:<br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;<br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content;</p><p>'One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;<br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million <br>years,<br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p><p>'My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution;<br>And I know the amplitude of time.'</p><p>This bold and almost arrogant confxml:idence is now apparently being justified. Though not popular in the sense that he is wxml:idely read, or that his works are to be found, as Whittier's are saxml:id to be, in almost every house in the United States, Whitman has on the American continent a large and increasing circle of readers. Outsxml:ide of America his admirers are more numerous still. Like Fourier, he may be saxml:id to have his propagandists in many lands. On the continent of Europe some of his works have been translated into several languages, while in England, where his worth was early recognised, he has secured the warm, and on the whole judicious advocacy of poets and critics like Swinburne, Buchanan, W.B. Bell, W.M. Rossetti, Symonds, and Professor Dowden, and of his popularity amongst ourselves not the least significant sign is the publication of the two handsome volumes, the titles of which we have placed first at the head of this paper.</p><p>In these volumes is contained, it would appear, all that Whitman desires to be preserved of his published writings. The one bearing the title Specimen Days and Collect is, with the exception of one or two juvenile pieces, in prose, and as the title indicates, is of very varied contents. First of all, we have a number of pages in which Whitman gives an account—an account, we may remark in passing, which is not without interest—of his ancestry and early days. Next, we have a number of memoranda written during the war of attempted secession, and here copied verbatim from a series of 'soil'd and creas'd livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket,' and 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain,' having been 'hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom admit the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march.' The memoranda here given from these 'lurxml:id and blood-smutch'd little note-books' bear all the marks of their origin. They are written in swift, vigorous, telling words; while the intense realism by which they are pervaded, and the terrible scenes which they depict, often make their reading exceedingly impressive. Following these, and forming the concluding part of the Specimen Days, is a number of memoranda written during and after the author's recovery from a serious and prolonged illness, brought on by his exertions during the war, and consisting, for the most part, of descriptions of natural and human scenes. They are full of fine thought and feeling, and are frequently not less poetical than some of the finer passages in his poems. In the Collect are included the remarkable essay entitled 'Democratic Vistas,' the prefaces to the various issues of his poems, and a paper on 'American Poetry.'</p><p>Whitman's prose is, in our opinion, not equal to his verse. Passages of great beauty and power occur; but taken as a whole the style is less terse and vigorous. It is marred, too, by mannerisms, and particularly by the frequent occurrence of long and often clumsy parentheses. As a rule the shorter pieces are written in much sounder and healthier English than the longer, though some of these are admirably written, and lead one to suspect, as a not unfriendly critic has observed, 'that his every-day prose is distorted intentionally.' For a right understanding of Whitman's poetry, however, a careful study of his prose writings, and more especially of the section having the somewhat strange, though not all together inappropriate, designation of 'Collect,' is indispensable. It is here that he explains himself, and unfolds the aims and principles by which he is guxml:ided and inspired.</p><p><em>Leaves of Grass</em>, originally, as we have remarked, a thin quarto of about a hundred pages, has now grown into a goodly sized octavo of nearly four hundred closely printed pages, containing close upon three hundred separate poems. Whitman has given regular titles to comparatively few of them. Most of them are headed instead with their first line or phrase, as, e.g. 'As I pondered in silence,' 'I hear America singing,' 'When I heard at the close of the day.' The greater part of them are distributed under the headings—'Inscriptions,' 'Children of Adam,' 'Calamus,' 'Birds of Passage,' 'Sea-drift,' 'By the Roadsxml:ide,' 'Drum-taps,' 'Autumn Rivulets,' 'Whispers of Heavenly Death,' 'From Noon to Starry Eye,' 'Songs of Parting.' Unconnected as they seem, however, it must not be supposed that they have no connection or are without arrangement. Though without formal connection, they have one which is real, and are intended to be read in the order in which they stand, as what may not unfitly be called an Epic of Life. On first reading, as most readers will probably acknowledge, they are somewhat repellent. There is so much in them we do not expect to find, so little respect is paxml:id to our conventional xml:ideas, and the author obtrudes himself so ostentatiously upon our attention, that after a few lines, we are disposed to throw the book asxml:ide as a compound of egotism and nonsense. On further reading, however, the illusion is gradually dispelled. First the attention is arrested by single lines or isolated passages, and as we proceed we become aware of an intellectual wealth and suggestiveness, a subtle charm, a personal force, a rush and glow of overmastering passion which we have seldom met with elsewhere; and though there are passages from which we turn away with repugnance, we cease to wonder at the warm and extremely eulogistic terms in which the admirers of Whitman are in the habit of speaking of him.</p><p>But whatever our estimate of Whitman's writings may be, Whitman himself is unquestionably a notable figure, certainly one of the most notable America has produced. As Professor Dowden has remarked,—'What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass, is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-word clay nor cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timxml:idly from behind his work to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am, a solxml:id and not inconsxml:iderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications; he attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love: or our extreme repugnance. However we feel toward him we cannot despise him. He is a 'summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be gotten rxml:id of. Passed by he cannot be.'‡ Nor are the sources of this singular power far to seek. They are to be found not so much in his art, for as an artist he is in some respects confessedly weak, but in the lofty purpose by which he is inspired, and in the ardent, and almost fierce enthusiasm with which he has from first to last devoted himself to it. This purpose, to put it in the fewest words, is nothing less than to inaugurate in America, by means of a genuinely native imaginative literature, a new era of intellectual and spiritual development. Or to put it differently, and to use the eloquent words of W. M. Rossetti, he 'occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one—a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the continent, or the Washington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America.' This purpose is surely a noble one, and which, if at all seriously followed, cannot fail to be fruitful in extraordinary power. And that this is the purpose which Whitman has continually set before him he has frequently declared. 'Democratic Vistas,' his various Prefaces, and several other of his prose essays may be taken as a sort of apology justifying it. But, nowhere has he given more noble utterance to it, as Mr. Rossetti has also pointed out, than in the following lines:—</p><p>'Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,<br>I will make the most splendxml:id race the sun ever shone upon,<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades,<br>'I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, <br>and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,<br>I will make inseparable cities with their arms around each other's necks,<br>By the love of comrades<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>'For you, these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!<br>For you, for you, I am trilling these songs.'</p><p>Besxml:ides an 'imperious conviction and the commands of his nature as total and as irresistible as those which make the sea flow, or the globe revolve,' Whitman's incentives to this great and unquestionably beneficent task are partly in the condition of American society, and partly in the character of American literature.</p><p>The spectacle presented by American society he describes as 'appalling.' Everywhere he sees hollowness, hypocrisy, deceit; in the business classes a depravity 'infinitely greater than has been supposed;' 'corruption, falsehood, and maladministration in branches and departments of the official services, whether national, state, or municipal;' in 'fashionable life flippancy, tepxml:id armours, weak infxml:idelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time;' 'in literature a scornful superciliousness;' 'in the churches and sects the most dismal phantasms usurping the name of religion.' 'The best class we shew,' he writes, 'is but a mob of fashionably-dress'd speculators and vulgarians.' Though an unwavering believer in democracy, and joyfully recognising the 'immense success of the New World democracy in lifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain species of intellectual culture,' he is nevertheless painfully oppressed by the conviction that so far 'in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, esthetic results, it is almost a complete failure,' 'in vain, he exclaims, 'do we march with unprecedented strxml:ides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annexed Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north to Canada and south to Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.' Or take the following passage from the 'Democratic Vistas,' which, while it illustrates his style in prose writing, clearly indicates one at least of the reasons why he has devoted himself to his self-imposed task:—</p><p>'Let me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations, localities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition. After an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bays, sparkling sea txml:ides, costly and lofty new buildings, facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich ships, the wharves, the great Central Park and the Brooklyn Park of hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)—the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters—these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my sense of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the east and north rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in the Wall Street, or the Gold Exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas—but in the artificial, the work of man, too, is equally great—in this profusion of teeming humanity—in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships—these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p><p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real importance, personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask—Are there, indeed, men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Is there a great moral and religious civilization—the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infxml:idelity—everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe—everywhere an abnormal libxml:idinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood decreasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (consxml:idering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p><p>Turning to the literature of America, any 'breath recuperative of sane and heroic life' to breathe into these lamentable conditions, Whitman nowhere finds. That which he observes to be everywhere lacking is native or original power. Workers in a certain sort of literature he sees in abundance; but 'touched by the national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality, they wither,' he affirms, 'to ashes.' 'I have not seen,' he remarks, 'a single writer, artist, lecturer, or what not, that has confronted the voiceless, but ever erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the land, in a spirit kindred to itself.' And, again, 'consxml:idered with reference to purposes of patriotism, health, and noble personality, religion, and the democratic adjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic plays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of our best xml:ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish no one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no one, and suffice only the lowest levels of vacant minds.' Morally and artistically, he affirms, America has as yet originated nothing. 'We see the sons and daughters of the New World,' he observes, 'ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the universal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and the dead. We see London, Paris, Italy—not original, superb, as where they belong, but secondhand here, where they do not belong. We see the shreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks, but where on her own soil do we see, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.' The central point of a nation, and that whence it is swayed and sways others, that which consolxml:idates its various parts, and is the source at once of its inspiration and influence, is, he believes, its national literature, and more especially its archetypal poems, but any such literature or poems America, he maintains, does not possess.</p><p>What then is the literature he desires and to what extent has he realised this desire in his own works? The answer to the first of these questions the foregoing paragraphs have already suggested. Those who wish for a fuller and more explicit answer we must refer to Specimen Days and Collect, and more especially to the 'Democratic Vistas,' the Prefaces of 1855 and 1876, and to the essay on 'Poetry To-day in America—Shakespeare—The Future,' where Whitman has unfolded his xml:ideas at consxml:iderable length, and frequently with great eloquence and power. In the space now remaining at our disposal we shall point out one or two of the features of the literature he has produced, premising, however, that many of the questions we shall be obliged to pass over in silence.</p><p>Whitman's principle defect, as a poet, lies, as it seems to us, and as we have already saxml:id, in the direction of his artistic power. That which strikes the reader first on opening Leaves of Grass is the singular appearance of its pages. The ordinary forms of versification Whitman has discarded, and adopted in their stead one which reminds us of Ossian, the writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the Vedas. By his thorough-paced admirers this is claimed as a sign of originality and strength. In our opinion, it is a sign of weakness. A really great poet, one, that is, who is thoroughly perfect in all the branches of his art, is a master of expression. Whitman confessedly is not. After many trials he was forced, he tells us, to give up the attempt to express himself in the forms employed by the great poets of the principal literary nations, and to use the mode he has here adopted. There is running through his works, as Mr. Rossetti has very truly remarked, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical movement and a sustained melody which are admirable, as for example—'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,' 'O Captain, my Captain,' 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed.' These, however, are exceptions. Generally speaking, Whitman's lines are deficient in melody. Music of a certain kind they certainly have; but they want the measured cadence, the flowing melody, that exquisite rhythmical charm which makes the words of the great poets take hold of the mind and live in the memory as the sweetest strain of a noble song. Nor can it be saxml:id that by adopting this peculiar mode of versification Whitman has secured any advantages superior to those afforded by the ordinary forms. That he has obtained a greater freedom may probably be admitted; but it is questionable whether it is not at the expense of effectiveness. To take but a single illustration. The thought of the following is admirable:—</p><p>'There was a child went forth every day:<br>And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;<br>And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part <br>of the day,<br>Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years<br>         .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .     <br>  The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt-marsh <br>and shore-mud;<br>These become part of that child who went forth every day, and <br>who now goes, and will always go forth every day.'</p><p>But compare with it Wordsworth's treatment of the same theme:—</p><p>'The stars of mxml:idnight shall be dear<br>To her: and she shall lean her ear<br>In many a secret place,<br>Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br>And beauty born of murmuring sound<br>Shall pass into her face.'</p><p>Whatever may be saxml:id in favour of Whitman's treatment, the advantages, so far as general effectiveness is concerned, are plainly with Wordsworth. The last two lines, besxml:ides having a fulness and suggestiveness about them quite equal to all that Whitman has saxml:id, or has attempted to say, have a music and a charm of expression on which the ear delights to dwell. Whitman's neglect of the art of expression is calculated, we think, to tell greatly against him. That he is capable of great things in this way we do not doubt. The poems referred to above, and others we could name, are a proof of the consummate work he might have done, had he been less impatient of restraint and more devoted to the perfecting of his skill in what is in reality one of the main sources of the poet's power. It must not be supposed, however, that Whitman is indifferent to the charms of art, or that, in his revolt against conventionalism, he has no rules or principles of his own. To those who imagine so we commend the perusal of what follows from the Preface of 1855:—</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity—nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the road-sxml:ide, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of some flowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writings any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. What I tell I tell precisely for what is. Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my sxml:ide and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>In 'Children of Adam,' Whitman has sinned, we think, against good taste, common sense, and, in fact, as one of his critics has pointed out, against one of his own canons. True, he has probably violated no moral law, and has simply spoken of what nature permits. It is true also that according to Schiller, whatever nature permits, is permitted also to art. Still, there are some things on which men have agreed to be silent, and though we are by no means disposed to regard conventionality as the standard of morals, we cannot avoxml:id the conviction that by speaking of the sexual relations in the way in which he has, Whitman has violated a natural instinct of the human mind. That he is an immoral writer, as some of his critics have maintained, we do not believe. His fault is one of manner rather than of spirit, and has its origin in an error of judgement rather than in a wrong bias of the mind. His deepest spirit and highest aim are, it seems to us, religious; and nothing, we imagine, but a strong sense of duty could have made him withstand so patiently and persistently the fierce storm of invective and abuse which some of his poems have aroused against him.</p><p>Whitman's faults, however, are greatly outweighed by his merits. First we may notice that in spirit he is intensely American. In the poets of other lands he is evxml:idently well read; yet, he is an imitator of none. His manner, style, and spirit are entirely his own. Previous to him the poetry of American was, as has been justly observed, merely the poetry of apt pupils, with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. The poems of Bryant and Longfellow might have been written as easily on the banks of the Thames as on the banks of the Hudson. There is little in them that is distinctively American. Whitman's poems, on the other hand, are saturated through and through with the spirit of the New World. 'Starting from Paumanock,' 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,' 'A Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Broad Axe,' 'A Song for Occupations,' 'Pioneers! O Pioneers!' 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' 'Drum-taps,' and 'Sea Drift,' it may be safely saxml:id, could not have been written elsewhere than on the American Continent, or by one whose spiritual life had not been reared among its people, and nourished by a life-long communion with its magnificent natural phenomena. Whitman is American also in another sense. He is thoroughly democratic. The Presxml:ident is no more to him than a mason, or woodsman, or western farmer. Any breath of a political aristocracy, of feudalism, or of caste, is not allowed to taint his pages. Their xml:ideas and institutions are entirely alien to his spirit. He could no more have written the xml:idylls of the King, or a play of Shakespeare than he could have written the Iliad. The doctrine which he preaches on every page is the greatness of the indivxml:idual soul. While Spencer writes 'to fashion a gentleman or nobleperson in virtuous and gentle discipline,' Whitman writes to build up a new and splendxml:id race of average men. As a poet of Democracy, as Democracy exists in the New World, he stands alone.</p><p>'The messages of great poets to each man and woman,' he has remarked, 'are, Come to us on equal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you. What we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy.' Of his own poems, this is a marked feature. Their directness is unquestionable. They place the reader on a level with themselves, and make him feel that he is being addressed by one who is of the same flesh and blood as himself, by one whose thoughts and feelings are, or may be his own. And the reason is that, subjective as Whitman's poems are, and distinctively as they teach the doctrine of indivxml:idualism, they always rest on that which is universally human. Perhaps no other poet of the present has a larger vision of that 'great human heart by which we live,' or more persistently announces it. The 'self' of which he sings is not always his own indivxml:idual self; as frequently, if not more so, it is the universal self, that universal being of which each indivxml:idual is but a conscious manifestation. Of this any one can convince himself by a careful reading of the 'Song of Myself.' Take, for instance, the following lines:—</p><p>'I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning <br>and the end.<br>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now;'</p><p>or take the lines with which the song opens:—</p><p>'I celebrate myself, and sing of myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belongs to me as good as belongs to you;'</p><p>or these:—</p><p>'The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br>The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,<br>The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps <br>by his wife;<br>And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br>And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>And of these one and all I weave the song of myself,'</p><p>This mysticism, indeed, forms the background of all Whitman's more important pieces, and is the key to their meaning. Without a clear apprehension of it it is impossible to understand the paradoxes in which his pages abound, or to reconcile his apparent contradictions. Were it not that we have Mr. Burroughs' assertion to the contrary, we should have attributed Whitman's mysticisms to a close study of Emerson. It seems, however, that before he published the first edition of the Leaves of Grass, Whitman had never read Emerson at all, and that he dxml:id not become acquainted with the Essay until the following summer. The similarity of their xml:ideas is remarkable, and may probably be taken as significant of the tendency of American thought.</p><p>Whitman is pre-eminently a poet of the modern world. No other has more thoroughly adopted the conclusions of science, or made a more splendxml:id and impressive use of them in his writings. Not unseldom they give a vastness and grandeur to his thought, which is well-nigh overwhelming. At the same time he is very far from being in any sense or degree a materialist. The supremacy of the spiritual he always loyally, and sometimes ostentatiously, recognises. Though almost Greek in his sympathy with nature, and notwithstanding the manner in which he has sung of man's physical constitution, the position which he assigns to the soul is always incomparably higher, as the following from his Preface of 1876 clearly shows:—</p><p>'Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a higher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too) the spiritual the religious—which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred-fold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the divine, and of the xml:ideal, through mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the objective worlds… To me the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendxml:id theology, and for ampler and diviner songs.'</p><p>Still, notwithstanding his modern tone of thought, and the democratic spirit which pervades his writings, the past is by no means disdained by Whitman. Past, present, and future, he holds, are not disjoined but joined. The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been. The present, he affirms, is but a stage in the eternal process of creative thought, and is what is through the past. At the same time, however, while admitting his indebtedness to the past, and claming kinship with it, he asserts also his independence, and claims to stand in his own place with his own day about him:—</p><p>'I conn'd old times,<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.<br>In the name of These States shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophers, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, investors, governments long since<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted<br> hither<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it)<br>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more <br>than it deserves,<br>Regarding it all intensely a long while, then dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place with my own day here.'</p><p>We are warned, however, that our space is already exhausted, and can refer to but one other of the many features of Whitman's poetry. After pointing out that formerly he was consxml:idered the best poet who composed the most perfect work, or the one which was most complete in every respect, Sainte-Beuve has remarked that for us in the present the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's imagination and reflection; not he who has done the best, but he who suggests the most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, who leaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in your turn.' Judged by this standard Whitman deserves to take a place among the foremost. His works are preeminently suggestive. Any finished picture he seldom presents.

	"title": "Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman</p><p>———</p><p>TEN or twelve years ago I read in an English magazine a review of Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass.' It contained several selections from the book which induced a feeling of utter bewilderment. Since that time I have read sundry other compositions of the 'good gray poet,' and always the effect has been the same. As one stumbles through the uncouth chants, the mixed metaphors, the hirsute style, the ragged similes, and the rickety grammar of the 'Leaves of Grass,' he begins to feel that he is lost in a wild jungle, and must trust to luck to get out. The ordinary compass will avail him naught. The poet must be judged by none of the received standards.</p><p>In a recent issue of a New York journal, Walt Whitman casts a backward glance on his own road. Even in this sketch, it is no easy task to divine what he is driving at. His vagueness of style and elusiveness of thought pervade even this prose article in which he endeavors to set forth some of the motives and theories involved in his 'Leaves.' Criticism on that extraordinary production has taken the shape of indiscriminate eulogy, or has confined itself to a condemnation of the glaring vulgarity of the book. This general arraignment of the work for its immorality has probably been the cause of its sale. Let it be announced that the author has expunged from it all the unseemly passages, and he will find that it will very soon die. Walt Whitman has been chanting his own praises so long, and has made such noisy claims for his writing, that a criticism of his 'Leaves' may not be untimely. There is still considerable curiosity about him and his book, and some sort of settled opinion should be reached and a verdict pronounced upon the worth of his alleged poems. If they are rubbish, it is well enough to say so.</p><p>In his latest article Mr. Whitman says:</p><p>'Many consider the expression of poetry and art to come under certain inflexible standards, set patterns, fixed and immovable, like iron castings. To the highest sense, nothing of the sort. As, in the theatre of to-day, 'each new actor of real merit (for Hamlet or any eminent rôle) recreates the persons of the older drama, sending traditions to the winds, and producing a new character on the stage,' the adaptation, development, incarnation, of his own traits, idiosyncrasy, and environment,—'there being not merely one good way of representing a great part, but as many ways as there are great actors,'—so in constructing poems.'</p><p>There are certain inflexible standards for fine art and poetry as well as for the stage, and the wings of genius have never lagged because of them. An actor recreates Hamlet by his personal magnetism, his subtler grasp of Shakespeare's meaning, his finer mastery of motives underlying the character, and his ability to project an animated, picturesque portraiture upon the sensibilities of the audience. Suppose, however, he undertook to play the part in a cutaway coat, a plug hat, corduroy trowsers, and green stockings; suppose he interpolated modern 'gags' in the soliloquies, or recited 'To be or not to be' while standing on his head! He would be original, but intolerable. However great might be his genius, however fiercely he might cast stage traditions to the winds, there are certain standards he could not destroy. He would have to preserve the dignity of the character, its psychological prominence, its intensity, and its morbid intellectuality. In literature it is the same. Standards of some kind must ballast the writer, or he may go on to Ursa Major. There are two kinds of literature,—prose and poetry; and, as Monsieur Jourdan says, everything written is either one or the other. Unless some kind of metrical arrangement is observed by a writer, then his production is prose. Emerson is allowed to diverge widely from ordinary rhythm, but no one doubts that he has written poetry. Whitman claims that his 'Leaves' are poems, using the word in the old Greek sense, probably. It is hard to admit that the 'Leaves' are either prose or poetry. Nothing but a purgatory of their own is adapted to their reception. They are literary mermaids, without the legendary interest associated with those mythologic characters.</p><p>But Mr. Whitman says 'no one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt at such performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or aestheticism. I hope to go on record for something different—something better, if I may dare to say so.' No one is likely to insist that the poet aimed very sedulously at art; but if 'Leaves of Grass' is not a literary performance, what is it? It is surely not a scientific treatise nor a passage of music. It is a literary work, and when Mr. Whitman does not want it judged as such he appears in the part of the man endeavoring to escape the issues he himself has forced. There are curt, balky, uneasy writers who bring us divine messages in their ungraceful way; they leave with us burning thoughts leading to higher resolves and splendid aspirations. Their style may be deplorable, but we understand them. We know that they bear a message to us, and do not expect from them facility of verse or even pliancy of language. Their meaning is clear, their thought sharply outlined, their purpose tangible and coherent.</p><p>Is Mr. Whitman such a writer? Most assuredly he is not. While it would be unfair to him to judge his work by the 'set patterns,' it is certainly allowable to look at it from the standpoint of common sense. We have a right to insist that all reputable work shall have a meaning, and it is permissible to criticise its aim, to show where it has failed or succeeded, to point out its beauties or its defects. It is true that the violet-ink novelists, like Howells and James, decry all purpose in literature; but their own productions are sufficient refutation of their theories. The man who writes or acts without a purpose is a fool.</p><p>What is the raison d'etre of 'Leaves of Grass'? Has the author ever stated in intelligible English the purpose of his book? Is its aim moral, political, scientific, aesthetic? Is it written in the interest of democracy, or of the intellectual classes? Very likely its author would claim that its purpose is collective. Has it inspired any one with greater love for humanity; has it caused the torch of patriotism in the hand of any individual to burn the brighter; has it lifted a single soul from its despair; has it brought sunshine to any heart; has it given new hopes; has it sweetened religion; has it encouraged science; has it given new wings to the imagination; has it led the intellect into new paths of light and knowledge; has it cleared up any of our doubts or thrown the slightest ray of helpful light upon our questionings? If it has done none of these things, the reason of its being is not apparent.</p><p>But, some of Mr. Whitman's admirers say, it is written from a democratic stand-point. If this is the case, the people ought to be able to understand it; but the ordinary man would regard 'Leaves of Grass' as the production of a maniac. Only the 'gifted few' can discover any sense in 'Leaves of Grass'; and what particular message they get from it is past the comprehension of one of the ungifted many. The work, of course, is defective in its literary form. Even its author admits that. Moreover, it has the faults of bad grammar, incomplete sentences, misuse of words, and incoherence of ideas. There is about as much consecutiveness in the 'Song of Myself' as there is in a dream originating in too much shrimp salad for supper. A transcript of the dream would be as valuable as the 'Song of Myself.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman says that 'the volumes were intended to be most decided, serious, bona fide expressions of an identical individual personality—egotism if you choose, for I shall not quarrel about the word.' In this connection, Mr. Whitman quotes a saying of Carlyle's, that 'there is no grand poem in the world but is at bottom a biography—the life of a man.' It is noticeable here that Carlyle does not say an autobiography. Mr. Whitman is mistaken. The 'ego' is usually voted a nuisance in fiction and works of imagination. And it is just as well for us to continue setting down as a vain and disagreeable fellow the man who speaks always of himself as if he were the universe. Egotism hardly does justice to Mr. Whitman's condition. It should be termed the delirium of self-conceit.</p><p>The 'Song of Myself' is probably a fair sample of Walt Whitman's style and purposes, and there is no injustice in judging him by it. If the critic or the laborious reader were to devote himself to this 'poem,' what would he find in it? I will attempt a partial summary of it. He begins by saying 'I celebrate myself and sing myself.' After celebrating and singing himself, he continues: 'I loafe, and invite my soul.' We may define him then to be a sort of loafer-poet. Having shown that he is not too much of a loafer to be a poet, and vice versa, he continues: 'I harbor for good or bad. I permit to speak at every hazard nature without check, with original energy.' In other words, he erases the words restraint, modesty, and shame from his vocabulary, and drops the distinction between decency and indecency. He would confound all our previous conceptions of good and evil; and, if his theory were carried out, where would be maidenly modesty and youthful delicacy? He might as well contend that everybody should forswear clothes and strut about in puris naturalibus. The poet begins his pilgrimage in houses full of fragrance; then he goes out in the air to the bank by the wood and becomes undisguised and naked. 'I am mad,' he says, 'for the air to come in contact with me.' This is the language of the lunatic asylum rather than that of poetry. Then follows an enumeration of abstract and concrete things, about which he predicates nothing. It reminds one of the negro's story of the storm that blew down the house but left the roof standing. The poet fails to provide an adequate support for his words, but leaves them suspended in mid-air. After he has made mincemeat of these barbaric phrases, he says: 'Stop this day and night with me, and you shall possess the origin of all poems.' In the phantasmagoria that follows, if the reader can discover the origin of anything, he is entitled to it. Whitman continues:</p><p>'There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now;<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there now.'</p><p>This is the climax of nonsense, and carries one back to the alleged philosophers who claimed that motion was an impossibility, and pain a myth. What becomes of evolution, progress, civilization? There could be no more depressing belief than this, for it means nothing but universal death. Fortunately, it is disproved by science, by history, and by religion. After winging his way through another space of inky obscurity, the poet says: 'The unseen is proved by the seen, till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.' Now what does this mean? He starts out with the seen, which needs no proof, and establishes from it the unseen. So far, it is clear; but now the seen becomes unseen, and receives proof in turn. Proof of what? That it is unseen. The necessity for proving the unseen is not apparent. If the poet intends to convey the idea that there is an invisible order of things, an unseen universe, why does he not say so? And if he did, it is not a matter of proof or demonstration, but of hope and conjecture. His dictum is mere verbal jugglery.</p><p>The poet then exalts his body, and this physical delirium runs all through the song at intervals; but there is no new and divine message here. The doctors tell us that the body is not vile, nor any of its parts; and when a genuine poet called it the temple of God, he said all that was necessary to say concerning it. Whitman 'believes in the flesh and the appetites,' meaning libidinous desire. In this respect he is not unlike the libertine. Indeed, this 'Song of Myself' is the chant of the roué. Resuming, he enumerates the people around him, the events happening about him, the battles, the feelings, anything and everything that chances to run in his mind, and concerning them all he says:</p><p>'These come to me days and nights, and go from me again,<br>But they are not the Me myself.'</p><p>Has this passage any meaning? Whitman says he is not a battle, or a fever, or a dress, or a dinner, or a compliment. Neither is he a pancake, a turnip, or a sardine. If he means that his soul stands apart from and uncontrolled by matter, why not say so? If he means the contrary, why not say so? If he means that he is a mere isolated spectator of human events, is it not easy enough for him to make his meaning clear to the average intellect?</p><p>Then he announces to his soul that he believes in it, and goes on to chant: 'Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,' etc. Naturally, one would infer that he was still addressing his soul. If so, he becomes ridiculous; for he gives the soul a throat and a voice. When we read farther we find he is addressing some one else, but whom we cannot divine. He says:</p><p>'I mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning,'</p><p>etc. The matter that follows is too vulgar for quotation. The passage is simply nauseating and devoid of sense.</p><p>The next incident is a child's bringing him a handful of grass, and asking him what it is. Of course, he does not know, but he proceeds to make up a wild 'yawp' about it, nevertheless; and he drifts next to the subject of death, and says it is as lucky to die as to be born, and he knows it. For one, I don't believe he knows anything of the kind. He says:</p><p>'I am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;<br>I am the mate and companion of people, all just as<br>Immortal and fathomless as myself;<br>(They do not know how immortal, but I know).'</p><p>Nor is he a comet, a meteor, or a ring of Saturn. 'They do not know how immortal they are, but I know,' is evidently regarded by him as a valuable bit of confidence. The plebian mind, however, will wonder how there can be degrees of immortality. We could just as well ask how long a man would live if he lived forever.</p><p>Now follows another jungle of people and things, which he says are for him; but he omits to say why they are 'for him,' and what he intends doing with them. Let us catalogue them in regular order: Male and female, boys, those that love women, the proud man, the sweetheart, the old maid, mothers, mothers of mothers, lips, eyes, children, the baby, the youngster, the red-faced girl, the suicide, the corpse, the blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of promenaders, omnibus, driver, sleighs, clank of horses, jokes, snow-balls, hurrahs, the mob's fury, flap of litter, a sick man, meeting of enemies, oaths, blows, a fall, crowd, policeman, stones, groans, exclamations, speech, arrests, slights, assignations, rejections, etc. The writer gives us here a bare enumeration of living beings, inanimate objects, abstractions, that have no bearing on each other, obey no sequence, and teach no lesson. An inroad into Mitchell's geography would be far more significant and useful. As a description of a street scene it is lame, hueless, and unnatural.</p><p>The bard's next transition is to the country; but he fails to give us any connecting links to show whence he went, why he went, or whither he went, though he does not fail to tell us what he did when he got there. He did exactly what one would expect him to do, after one has read the 'Song of Myself' up to this point. Instead of acting as a rational man, he 'jumps from the cross-beams of the wagon, seizes the clover and timothy, and rolls head over heels and tangles his hair full of wisps.' This kind of individual would jump out of a third-story window, instead of contenting himself with viewing the prospect through it. He is next hunting out in the wilds; then he is at sea; then at a clambake; then at the marriage of a trapper and an Indian girl. A runaway slave comes to his house and sits next to him at his table. This episode fixes his attention for a moment, and his mind wanders again, and he sees twenty-eight young men bathing by the shore—</p><p>'Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:<br>Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.'</p><p>In the next paragraph the poet says:</p><p>'She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;<br>She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window.<br>Which of the young men does she like the best?<br>Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.<br>Where are you off to, lady? for I see you;<br>You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.<br>Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;<br>The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.<br>The beards of the young men glistened with wet, it ran from their long hair:<br>Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.<br>An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies;<br>It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.'</p><p>Who they are, what they have to do with the poem, how they could lead twenty-eight years of 'womanly' life, what difference it makes whether they were so friendly and so lonesome or not, how they could be so lonesome if there were twenty-eight of them, and how they could be so friendly if they were all lonesome, are a few of the riddles suggesting themselves to the mind of the unbeliever in reading this passage. It has been suggested to me that the paragraph is intended as a picture of twenty-eight women who are lonesome because deprived of the society of twenty-eight men who are accustomed to associate together to the neglect of the women; but the phrase 'twenty-eight years of womanly life' is hardly synonymous with 'twenty-eight women.' And who is this mysterious 'she,' and what is she doing? Is she engaged in the unmaidenly act of watching the men bathe? If there is a suggestiveness here except the suggestiveness of an unclean mind, it is not apparent.</p><p>By this time the reader is in a positive whirl; but the poet continues to exhibit his wax-works, and introduces the butcher-boy, the blacksmith, and possibly the baker and the candlestick maker. He next sees a negro driving a dray, and from him he goes by the usual degrees to the wild gander leading his flock. A little further on, 'the pure contralto sings in the organ loft,' and 'the carpenter dresses his plank.' Another convulsion seizes the writer at this juncture, and he gives us a catalogue of all sorts of people and professions. He jumps from a steam-boat to a ball, from one of the seasons to one of the States. At one time he is in Missouri, and at another in a street-car. There is no telling where he will alight next.</p><p>It would not be profitable to carry the analysis further. It is evident that the 'Song of Myself' leads nowhither, and that it is the unsystematic, unpruned expression of a very peculiar mind. A few more quotations may be pardoned, as showing to what extremes language can go. For instance, this abrupt paragraph:</p><p>'Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?'</p><p>It is, of course, impossible for the reader to say who goes there. Possibly he doesn't care. As for the second question, that may be respectfully referred to the physiologist, who can answer it to any man's satisfaction. One fails to see what the bard is hankering after, and why he is nude. The connection between his being mystical and his eating beef is also a mystery, from which he has not lifted the veil. Again he says:</p><p>'I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth.'</p><p>In one place he says, 'I know that I am deathless,' and in another declares himself a materialist. He speaks of the sea as the 'howler and scooper of storms.' He finds the scent of the armpits 'aroma finer than prayer.' These quotations might be strung out endlessly, but they would afford merely cumulative proof of the rankest kind of rebellion against common sense. It is not to be denied that at times the reader detects the gleam of the diamond in this mass of rubbish. The poet has evidently thought and read of many things, but his comments convey a hint of indigestion. When one finishes reading the 'Song of Myself,' it is impossible for him to give a rational review of what it is, and what it is intended to teach. It is a failure, because the writer has neglected that very art which he professes to despise. The word 'art,' which is as wide in its significance as the heavens, has often been degraded by careless thinkers into a synonym of form, when it is in reality the execution of truth. Thought is never valuable unless it is clear and comprehensible. An obscure thought is hueless, tasteless, and devoid of nourishment. If Mr. Whitman's thinking is obscure, it is not worth the preserving. On the other hand, his thoughts may be true and clear, but he may lack fitting expression, just as a man may have a perfect conception of harmony and have no voice for song. It is in giving adequate, tangible expression to clean, valuable thinking, that the writer or poet justifies himself. He should have something to tell, and he should tell it. Unless he can do so, he has no business posing as a poet. Shakespeare found the English language and the established modes of composition spacious enough for his transcendent genius. Cicero, Virgil, and Horace were not trammeled by the polished completeness of Latin. Dante could express all his thoughts in artistic Italian, while Goethe and Schiller never thought of rebelling against the rules of German grammar and the accepted modes of composition. The man who has a story to build will never fail for want of verbal tools; if he falters, it will be because he knows not how to use them. If he has a message to deliver, wings are convenient; but he must know how to fly with them. We have a right to insist that a definite subject or story shall be selected, and that it shall be developed artistically, and in such a way as to be grasped. When Wagner, the musical revolutionist, set about the consummation of his theories, every musician understood perfectly what his theories were, though many angrily doubted and denied that music could respond to the call he made upon it. In all his labor there were system, consecutiveness, and art; otherwise, he would have failed. Has Mr. Whitman enunciated an intelligible theory? He speaks vaguely about poetry being written under the influence of our democratic institutions. Well and good. Now, Dame Columbia may insist on free thought and free speech; but she is not maudlin, nor incoherent. Her head is clear, her mien self-reliant, her actions brisk and animated, her perception acute, and her imagination warm and glowing. There is nothing confused or aimless about her. A literature in accord with democracy would partake of these attributes. If Mr. Whitman desires an original American literature, his plea is praiseworthy. The material for a literature that will do honor to the English tongue is to be found in this country, and the mine is now being worked. I feel no hesitation in saying that the spirit of Mr. Whitman's poetry is the contrary of the democratic spirit, because it is deficient in clearness, in consistency, in art, and in common sense. At first blush there may seem to be a kinship of liberty; but the liberty of democracy is the highest evolutionary step in the struggle for the rights of man, while the liberty of Walt Whitman's poetry is license of thought and anarchy of expression. Most people take pride in conquering the thoughts which he takes a riotous glee in giving vent to.</p><p>The thinking man of to-day finds himself beset with in-crowding problems, and the mission of literature should be to relieve him from the depressing sense of the infinities. In no way can cheer be flashed into his darkened, perplexed mind except by preserving as a holy thing his faith in the unseen and spiritual, by keeping a line perpetually drawn between the just and the unjust, by placing what is good aloft in conspicuous splendor and sending evil to the gloomy shadows below; by preserving the ideals of purity and 'sweetness and light'; by fixing virtue on a lasting pedestal and dethroning vice from its seat in the hearts of men. The man who obscures these valuable results of moral teaching, who leaves a doubt in the mind as to whether good is preferable to evil, who exalts the flesh—that incubus upon the loftiest dreams of purity—and calls the soul the body, can hardly be considered as bringing with him a message that we are bound either to receive or to respect.</p><p>WALKER KENNEDY.</p>",

	"title": "'Leaves of Grass'",
	"body": "<p>'Leaves of Grass.'</p><p>———</p><p>A want of concentrative force, even a disposition to indolence, may be traced through the career of our author. He himself confessed to a friend that he had 'no talent for industry.' During his early years we find too many changes of occupation and scene, printing, editing, writing, publishing, teaching, joinering, house-building; one time in New York, another in New Orleans, then back again or up and down the country. This erratic temperament displays itself in the scrappy character of much of his literary work. Yet he was the reverse of an idle man. He always earned his bread. If his worldly gains were small, there was compensation in the modesty of his wants. He said he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread and water.</p><p>Whitman's admirers have certainly no right to complain that his energies were not centered on trade or other fortune making. All those years of miscellaneous occupation and variety of scene were his apprenticeship. The 'many a good day or half-day' on Long Island, of which he tells, riding, boating, walking, 'absorbing fields, shores, marine incidents, characters, the bay-men, farmers, pilots, fishermen,' by-and-by took form in poetry. So also did the city scenes in which he mingled; his jaunts on New York omnibuses, and intercourse with the drivers—'Broadway Jack,' 'Old Elephant,' 'Yellow Joe,' and the rest—and with the toilers in the workshops and with the loungers in the streets. 'I suppose the critics will laugh heartily,' he writes, 'but the influence of those Broadway omnibus jaunts, and drivers, and declamations, and escapades, undoubtedly entered into the gestation of Leaves of Grass.' He visited hospitals, alms-houses and prisons, attended political gatherings, frequented taverns, and was the friend of publicans and sinners. He was a good observer and a good hearer, and his curiosity was unbounded. He would take nothing from another's report, but must see and hear and feel for himself. The gods had provided a banquet of life, and he would taste of every dish, whether it were sweet or bitter. To a weaker spirit than his, it might have been a perilous thing to do. That which we call experience is the soul's vision of itself in the mirror of the world; the spectacle may well frighten those who dare not to discover, even to themselves, what they really are; but the strong, seeing their defects, aspire to perfection. To the well-constituted mind variety brings health, rough contact invigorates, the experiences of the world, smooth and rugged, yield pure benefit.</p><p>What precisely Whitman did during this period I do not know and am not interested to discover. The mere knowledge of a man's deeds may easily mislead the judgment. Did he do this or that? What does it signify? The vital questions are, What were his opportunities? what use did he make of them? how would he have behaved under other conditions? Whitman was never on trial with felons, yet he confessed himself as much a felon as those who were:</p><p>'You felons on trial in courts,<br>You convicts in prison cells; you sentenced assassins chain'd and <br>handcuff'd with iron,<br>Who am I, too, that I am not on trial or in prison?<br>Me, ruthless and devilish as any, that my wrists are not chain'd with<br> iron or my ankles with iron?<br>∗∗∗∗∗<br>O, admirers! praise me not—compliment me not—you make me <br>wince,<br>I see what you do not, I know what you do not.'</p><p>This bit of experience will find a responsive echo in many minds. Have we not all felt, some time in our lives, when we have been made confidants of some secret wrong or have witnessed the exposure of evil-doers, how equally guilty in all but the mere deed we also were? Nay, have we not felt we were in some sort worse than those others, because, being guilty, we were praised as innocent, or at least escaped due chastisement, merely because we did not make our guilt manifest in an act? Worthy John Bradford, when he saw a criminal carried to execution, used to say, 'There, but for the grace of God, goes John Bradford.' If it were not for the grace of God, or, if you prefer, the fortunate chance or the want of opportunity to do ill, not a few on-lookers, not a few reputed saints, would be standing side by side with the felons on trial in the courts.</p><p>Nevertheless, this acknowledgement of kinship in sin or in the possibility of sin, is only a half statement of the truth that sin itself is lesser or stunted virtue, just as darkness is only light too thinly spread for human eyes to perceive. Men never turn themselves from the good, though they do not keep it continually in view; and, though they stumble and hesitate, their look and movement are always onward.</p><p>How Whitman emerged from his experiences must be shown in his life, yet it is worth while to note that he is not blamed for these experiences, but for making a record of them. While others have been superficial and circumspect in what they wrote, he has striven to be thorough, and great has been the disgust that what every one secretly knew and was thinking of or timidly hinting, he should boldly declare. Such unaccustomed thoroughness caused an outcry; but he felt that, if he was to depict man at all, his presentment must be entire.</p><p>Yet Whitman's honest bluntness is not without a touch of bravado, I think. It comes primarily from an intellectual conviction that in nature there are no indecencies, and to this conviction he resolves to give the fullest utterance. For his part, nothing being improper, nothing shall be suppressed. Mr. Lowell's remark that Fielding 'had the courage to be absolutely sincere if he had not always the tact to see where sincerity was out of place' may be not inaptly applied to Whitman. There is much, too, in the way a thing is treated, and Whitman's touch, it must be admitted, is not delicate. His speech is open but not quite spontaneous; not as free and natural, for example, as the language of Fielding in some of his books. He is aware that he is doing rather a daring thing. He must wonder a little what the effect will be upon his readers. In other words, his expression of himself is conscious. Perhaps in our age this is unavoidable. Thackeray lamented that the condition of the time prevented him from using absolutely sincere expressions, and possibly he would have been a happier man and a healthier writer if he had had the liberty he craved. It is related that when Bayard Taylor was a child, his mother, who had been a Quakeress, tried so constantly to impress upon him the wickedness of profane swearing, that his imagination became centered on oaths, and he was filled with an uncontrollable desire to swear. So he went into the fields, beyond hearing, and there gave vent to all the oaths he had ever heard or could invent, in as loud a voice as possible. After this he felt happy. The human race may have been in a like predicament until Whitman relieved it, for a time, by his bold utterance. At any rate, I think thereby he relieved himself and, having written the section of his book called 'Children of Adam,' was free for the efficient performance of work more generally acceptable and useful. And, after all, the chief point is whether the statement he makes is true or false.</p><p>Out of his experience Whitman constructed his book. Leaves of Grass was begun on the shores of Long Island in 1853, the author being then thirty-four years old. He set it in type himself in the printing-office of a friend. It contained twelve pieces in verse and a preface in prose. In 1855 it appeared. A thousand copies were printed. Some were sent to newspapers and to public men, and afforded a certain amount of amusement to the recipients. The style was curious, and some of the ideas seemed odd and uncouth. Emerson, however, chancing upon a copy, discerned its value. He alone, of all the persons who saw the work, perceived that there was something worthy in it. He thought he discerned the signs of genius in its early dawn, and wrote straightway to the author to tell him that in his book he had found 'incomparable things said incomparably well. . . . The solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Few if any copies of the book were sold.</p><p>The second edition was issued in 1856, a much thicker volume than the first. It contained some of the pieces which are now gathered together in the section called 'Children of Adam,' and these changed the scornful laughter of the critics into angry denunciation. The sharp controversy to which they gave rise has not yet wholly subsided. The prose preface had disappeared or rather had taken poetical form. Since then several editions have appeared with varying but for the most part small fortune. One publisher failed; others grew timid and withdrew. The current edition issued in 1881, is the only one which, commercially, has proved a marked success.</p><p>When the fourth edition was published, Whitman had gathered an important, new experience to be woven into poems. The Civil War had taken place. His brother having been wounded in an early engagement, he went to the front to nurse him. Once there, his sympathy with suffering was too strong to permit him to return. It is on record that he was careful to have his name on the roll of volunteers eligible for service, but he was not drafted. In the hospitals he found work as useful and as arduous, and needing as much courage as service in the army itself. But it was congenial, for his heart was more in saving than in slaying. It is said that during the war he personally tended or in some way aided not fewer than 100,000 wounded soldiers. Some of these services seem slight enough. A passing kindly word or touch or smile; but the suffering and lonely men appreciated such tokens of love. To not a few the last earthly vision was of that countenance glowing with tenderness. Whitman's aim was not to supplant but to suplement the doctors and nurses by giving aid which they had not the time, even if they had the understanding to give. He knew that more was needed than medical and surgical skill; that to these soldiers on beds of sickness, often of death, far from their friends, the power of a touch of home-tenderness would be magical. Hence, in many instances he gave true and substantial aid by pressing a hand or by a kiss or a smile or a word of cheer as he passed the bed; or he would write a letter to wife or mother, or give a little money or tobacco or an orange, or receive a message from the dying. Humane persons in different parts of the country sent him money and stores to carry on his work, and not a little came from his own pocket. A small volume called Drum Taps, issued in 1865, is Whitman's record of his war-experiences. To it he appended a few pathetic pieces referring to the death of President Lincoln. All are now incorporated with Leaves of Grass.</p><p>In connection with these experiences, nothing is more significant than the expansion of Whitman's sentiment towards death. Already in his 'Song of Myself' he had said, 'As to you, Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try and alarm me . . . And, as to you, Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths, (no doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before).' But in the war and the tragedy of President Lincoln's death at its close, that which before had been perceived by the intellect has fused itself, by experience, into the life. He has faced death, mingled with it, borne it daily through four terrible years, and now he can sing his glowing chants of 'heavenly death.' The poet of life will, henceforward, be the poet of death also. Here, as I think, is Whitman's real advance beyond his predecessors. Others have treated death as a 'dread monster,' an enemy, or, like Emerson, have steadily ignored it. Even Goethe said, 'Death is something so strange that, notwithstanding all experience, one thinks it impossible for it to seize a beloved object; and it always presents itself as something incredible and unexpected.['] No doubt Spinoza was right when he said, 'A free man thinks of nothing less than of death, and his wisdom is not a meditation upon death but upon life.' But Whitman has demonstrated the power of a free man to find the blessedness of death as well as the blessedness of life. He alone hails it lovingly as a friend:—</p><p>'Come lovely and soothing death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later delicate death.</p><p>'Prais'd be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,<br>And for love, sweet love—but praise! praise! praise!<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.</p><p>'Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come <br>unfalteringly.'</p><p>Towards the close of the war Whitman contracted blood-poisoning in the hospital, and thus, at 45 years of age, was stricken with the first serious illness of his life. He never quite recovered, although after a short interval he resumed his ministrations. When the war was over he obtained, successively, two offices under the American Government. From the first he was dismissed, because he was the author of Leaves of Grass, and Mr. Harlan, the head of his department, did not approve of the book; and to the second, under the Attorney-General, he was appointed because of his dismissal from the first. Here he remained until 1873, when, at length, the hardship and sickness of the war time, followed as it was by too frugal living that he might have more to dispose in charity, laid him low with paralysis.</p><p>Whitman bore sickness and destitution in the same calm spirit with which he had met the many previous changes of his life. No longer able to be an active helper in the world, his time henceforth, for several years, was spent away from cities; and in the abounding life of the country he formed new ties of fellowship with animals, trees and flowers. Some of the best passages in his note books and poems relate to this period, and very touching are these records of the poet's simple life when, broken in health by labours of love among his fellow-men, he sought rest and, as far as might be, to renew the vigour he had lost. Nature is always tender to a noble spirit, and she treated him well.</p><p>The enjoyment Whitman derives from nature apart from man, is sensuous and something more. Nature is health-giving and restful, and appeals to his sense of beauty, but it also touches his spiritual sense. In the birds, insects, animals and trees he feels the presence of the same soul which he himself shares. 'I have a positive conviction,' he says, 'that some of these birds fly and flirt about here for my especial benefit.' For the sea he had a peculiar regard. Mr. Conway, who bathed with him, noticed that he fairly hugged the water. Passages throughout his works indicate this affection. He speaks of 'the soothing rustle of the waves.' He relates that when a boy he had a wish to write a poem about the sea-shore, 'that suggestive dividing line, the solid marrying the liquid.' But afterwards he felt that instead of making this his theme, it should be, rather, 'an invisible influence' pervading his work. It is interesting to observe that the restful unrest and the vastness of the sea do typify his poems.</p><p>If Whitman does not deliberately claim to be the Poet of the Modern, assuredly he would not repudiate the title. He really accepts the mission when he says, 'the modern man I sing;' and when, throughout his prose as well as his poetry, he proclaims how ample are the materials to his hand in the affairs of to-day, for the making of poems. Dr. Bucke, his intimate friend and truly able biographer, who plays Boswell to Whitman's Johnson, reports: 'He said to me one day that he considered the most distinguishing feature of his own poetry to be 'its modernness—the taking up in their own spirit of all that specially differentiates our era from others, particularly our democratic tendencies.'' Hitherto feudalism or the system of the past had been the theme of poets. They sang of chivalry, of wars, warriors, and kings, nor does he discard these:</p><p>'In the name of the States, shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.'</p><p>Nevertheless, Whitman's own theme shall be America, the type of the modern, built on the antique; and by America he means, not the actuality of to-day so much as the ideal world of energy, freedom, and advancement. Yet he believed that 'this teeming nation of nations' was 'essentially the greatest poem.' Accordingly, he writes of America. Others have glorified man in his hour of repose; he will do this and more. The workman at the bench and the farmer in the field seem to him not less beautiful than the struggle and adventure chronicled by Shakespeare. The life of 'the average man, in average circumstances,' might, he believed, be 'still grand—heroic.' 'We owe to genius,' said Emerson, 'always the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common and showing us that divinities are sitting disguised in the seeming gang of gypsies and pedlars.' Man as a worker and the implements of his work are proper subjects for song:</p><p>'Ah little recks the labourer,<br>How near his work is holding him to God,<br>The loving Labourer through space and time.'</p><p>Goethe affirmed that 'at bottom no real object is unpoetical if the poet knows how to use it properly.' Thoreau found the spirit of music in the telegraph-pole, but it remained for Whitman to write a poem—strikingly picturesque—'To a Locomotive in Winter,' a 'Song of the Broad Axe,' and a 'Song of Occupations,' in which he says</p><p>'In the labour of engines and trades and the labour of the fields I <br>find the developments,<br>And find the eternal meanings.'</p><p>The chief difference between the poets of Chivalry and this poet of the Modern is a difference in their choice of illustrations. The former extolled honour and courage as displayed in battle; Whitman also extols honour and courage, but finds it here to-day in the street and the workshop, and he considers these spheres for the exercise of virtue the most appropriate for celebration in the poetry of the living present. There were poets of the Modern before Whitman, though none of them sang on principle, so to speak, as he does. In truth, he fills an undue proportion of his books, not in singing the modern, but in singing about singing it. I think it was Mr. Ernest Rhys who first drew a comparison between Whitman and Burns. Burns was truly a 'poet of the Modern' when in 'The Cottar's Saturday Night,' lifting the curtain from the common-place, he actually did, without any theories or announcements, sing 'the modern man.' Whitman, however, for the first time, treats man working, as a subject for poems.</p><p>I do not advise any one to read Leaves of Grass except as a whole. It would not be understood. Passages are easy to find which, when detached, seem foolish or offensive but which in their proper place contribute to the harmony of the structure. When one of the editions was in preparation a friend of Whitman urged him to omit certain passages, saying, 'What in the world do you want to put in that stuff for that nobody can read?' Whitman replied, 'Well, John, if you need to ask that question it is evident, at any rate, that the book was not written for you;' a fitting answer to other objectors.</p><p>Nevertheless, John's difficulty was not unnatural. It does take time to find the key to this poetry, and the first impression is likely to be the least favourable. Startling departures from literary conventionalities must be overcome. The initial trouble is the peculiar form—a kind of rhythmic prose. It seems calculated to obscure rather to elucidate the author's meaning. If Whitman's sense of the ludicrous had been more keen, there are passages in his book which he would by no means have admitted. He is an exceedingly literal man, a fact which makes his work precise and careful; but had he been something of a humourist his language and his grouping of facts would not have been quite what they are.</p><p>Tested by scholastic rules, I suppose Leaves of Grass would not be called poetry at all. It does not obey the laws of prosody, yet musicians have affirmed that it does obey the laws of music. When, however, the key of the meaning is found, the propriety of the form is felt; it almost seems as though no other form would have served. A comparison between Leaves of Grass and the finest Whitman's prose, shows that the former stands upon a level altogether higher than the latter. Here, as in all works of true power, the thought has created its own befitting form.</p><p>Leaves of Grass expresses a triune doctrine of Unity, Beauty, and Progression. It represents human nature as everywhere the same, and not human nature only, but animals, plants and what are called inanimate things also; it affirms that everything in its own place is beautiful, and that there is a tendency, through all, toward an unseen but certain goal. The 'comradeship' insisted upon so untiringly by Whitman is the corollary. That which we feel to be akin to us stimulates sympathy; and if all things belong thus one to another, universal brotherhood must result. Furthermore, if all things, however lowly, have their appropriate place and task, contempt is out of the question. To us, henceforth, there can be nothing 'common or unclean.'</p><p>The poems of Whitman's earlier period are full of city life, and breathe the spirit of fellowship which characterized those ferry boat and omnibus jaunts and the familiar intercourse of the streets. They are, in essence, poems of comradeship and sexual love. In majestic chants he presents a vivid picture of this wonderful life of the world, its contrasts and antagonisms on the surface and the oneness underneath. He notes the sights and sounds of a great city—the carter, the factory girl, the president, the boatman, the conductor, all attending to their various avocations. While here the slave is sold in the market, there the infant is baptized in the Church; in one place a drunken prostitute curses a jeering crowd, while, not far off, a convert is 'making his first profession.' The singer is singing in the organ loft, and the children 'ride home from their Thanksgiving dinner,' even while, elsewhere, 'the lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirmed case.' Thus, pain and pleasure mingling, life proceeds, while a man of large heart watches it with the eyes of a poet, and perceives the kinship of one with another and of himself with all. 'The known universe,' he says, 'has one complete lover, and that is the greatest poet.' This is the Comradeship of which he speaks so often, and his ministrations to the outcast men and women in the city streets and the prisons, and to the wounded soldiers in the war-hospitals, testify to the sincerity of his belief in comradeship. 'We believe only as deep as we live.' He not only wrote but lived 'the evangel poem of comrades and of love.' His sympathy extends to those whom society excludes. They too are members of the human family, having claims upon him,—claims all the greater because of the greater need. Let others cast stones if they choose; he will treat them, not with the partiality and prejudice of men, but in the spirit of nature:</p><p>'Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you,<br>Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to rustle <br>for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.'</p><p>He sees through the husk of sin to the soul beyond, and is filled with pity. The surpassing tenderness, without a trace of morbidness, of the piece called 'The City Dead House,' lingers long in the memory, and the lesson of charity it instills will not be readily effaced.</p><p>Whitman, I have said, preaches Beauty also; the universal fitness of things. He does not choose the good and discard the evil, but, shutting his eyes to nothing, he sees that the law of the universe is benefit. Failure! Evil! these are the reverse side, and as appropriate in their place as success and virtue in theirs:</p><p>'How perfect the earth and the minutest thing upon it!<br>What is called good is perfect, and what is called evil is just as perfect.'</p><p>'The chief end I purpose to myself in all my labours,' wrote Dean Swift, 'is to vex the world rather than divert it.' In the person of the 'Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,' we have still amongst us a very different type of man, whose purpose is to divert the world rather than to vex it. Yet Swift to vex the world, and Holmes to entertain it, alike expose the weakness and folly of mankind. They discover to their fellow-men the unsavoury realities of human life, Swift the low aims and hypocrisy of men, and Holmes their defects of speech and manners. The method of Whitman is different. He does not show humanity to be either hideous or ridiculous. Swift and, in more superficial fashion, Holmes, regard man as vile, and expose the faults they see, with a desire, perhaps, for their removal. The bulk of persons seem to regard man as vile, and strive not so much to remove the vileness as to hide it. Whitman looks deeper and sees only the beautiful.</p><p>The other feature of Whitman's doctrine is Progression, the eternal onward march of the soul. Life is a development, onward, 'for ever and for ever, longer than soil is brown and solid, longer than water ebbs and flows':</p><p>'This day, before dawn, I ascended a hill and look'd at the crowded <br>heaven,<br>And I said to my spirit, When we become the enfolders of these orbs, <br>and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them, shall we be <br>fill'd and satisfied then?<br>And my spirit said 'No.''</p><p>To show to man the dignity of his calling, that his path through life is fair and that he has a noble destiny, is the best service which can be rendered to virtue. When these truths are understood, grossness in thought or deed becomes impossible. Such a doctrine as Whitman's leaves no room for doubt or misgiving. It summons men to put forth their best powers. It demands nothing less than perfect manhood and womanhood. To the key-note which it strikes, the chord in the human heart that will respond is nobility,—the love of divine things and the high aim.</p><p>In any final estimate of Leaves of Grass, it is necessary to take into account the fact that, in spite of peculiarities of style and thought, and of relentless opposition encountered from the first, the book has steadily made its way. Many, whose opinion cannot be despised, have thought well of it. Emerson, as we have seen, admired it at the beginning. A quarter of a century later, George Eliot, being induced, with some difficulty, to read it, found that it contained what was 'good for her soul.' Mr. Swinburne, in the days when he was himself a poet, wrote friendly greetings to Whitman, but he has recanted, and scolds him now like Dr. Peter Bayne. Among Whitman's personal friends were Bryant and Longfellow. Thoreau, after visiting him with Alcott in 1856, came to the conclusion that 'We ought to rejoice greatly in him . . . he is a great fellow.' No success or reputation ever gets itself established unless it is rooted in character. Whitman, like his book, is strong. It is himself that speaks, not the echo of another. Abraham Lincoln, seeing him pass, said, 'Well, he looks like a man!' and it may be added, such a man purifies the age in which he lives.</p><p>WALTER LEWIN.</p>",
