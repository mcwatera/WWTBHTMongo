	"body": "<p>DRUM TAPS.—WALT WHITMAN. </p><p>The appearance of Walt Whitman's new book of poems, conjointly with Ward's 'Indian Hunter,'1 is not without significance. Both Whitman and Ward are representative men. In them, for the first time, the full strength of our American life receives expression—receives assertion. We have had in our Poetry and Art idealizations of loftier aspiration—imaginations of finer conceit—but they were not grounded in our soil; even though American in their reference, they were foreign to our New World; they belonged rather to some modern school of thought, than to our modern and American life—they were not the outgrowth of that new movement in civilization which America inaugurates.</p><p>In all human organizations, whether those of personal or of national life, there is the moment of consciousness as self, as individual—a moment full of original force.</p><p>This 'I Am' of youth, may include more or less of meaning according to the status of organic development. The youthful self-assertion of one age implies more than the assertion of an anterior epoch. Life is an ever on- flowing tide; each successive wave strands the human consciousness upon a higher look-out. The earlier ages expressed their consciousness of life, through the imagination, by mythical rites and symbols. America now first in the world's history experiences this life as superior to all forms—as ever forming -itself never bounded by form—as the common life, common as the 'leaves of grass'—as the great fraternizing element—as the all-sufficient—the vast, indomitable, sole Fact. In literature—Whitman, in art—Ward, are they who come forward to express this New-World self-assertion of ours, in all its boundless and fierce strength. Both fling aside the buskin and come down to the common ground; they state that which is, and thereby give the fact—the thing -its truest and highest idealization; for the fact—the thing—thus simply and absolutely given, is at once spiritual and material—is ideal.</p><p>As an artist—that is, as one who gives a complete and harmonious externalization to his feeling—Mr. Whitman is much inferior to Mr. Ward. Still the poet may be said to be more truly artistic than if he were more ostensibly so. He sets out to assert himself—the conscious American life as superior to restrictions of time and place, as all-containing, all-sanctifying. His inartistic looseness of style and expression is quite consistent with this mood. The poet, in consequence, presents himself to the mind as a more congruous and artistic whole than if he had modeled his verse in accordance with all the unities of Art.</p><p>In Whitman's last collection, we observe a much greater regard for beauty of form than the Leaves of Grass displayed. The latter work was full of the ungoverned vigor of life-consciousness; the present exhibits a tendency to define this vigor by lines of beauty. We accordingly discover greater regularity of rhythm, and more unity of conception in the grouping of details.</p><p>But our present object is to introduce an extract from Drum Taps, which may, we hope, incite the reader to a serious study of the works of its author—the most remarkable outgrowths of our New-World life. As the earlier poems were not a bouquet of garden flowers, but leaves of grass plucked by the handful from the bosom of nature, with here and there a wild blossom, fresh, juicy, wet with the dews of morning, so the recent ones—referring to that upheaving of the Great Life in human action which has marked our times—are not the elaborate martial strains of the parade-ground, but the vigorous 'drums taps' of the column in march.</p><p>PIONEERS!<br>O PIONEERS!<br>1.<br>Come, my tan-faced children,<br>Follow well in order, get your weapons ready;<br>Have you your pistols? have you your sharp-edged <br>axes?<br>Pioneers!

	"body": "<p>DRUM-TAPS.* </p><p>WILL saltpeter explode? Is Walt Whitman a true poet? Doubts to be solved by the wise futurity which shall pay off our national debt. Poet or not, however, there was that in Walt Whitman's first book which compels attention to his second. There are obvious differences between the two: this is much smaller than that; and whereas you had at times to hold your nose (as a great sage observed) in reading 'Leaves of Grass,' there is not an indecent thing in 'Drum-Taps.' The artistic method of the poet remains, however, the same, and we must think it mistaken. The trouble about it is that it does not give you sensation in a portable shape; the thought is as intangible as aroma; it is no more put up than the atmosphere.</p><p>We are to suppose that Mr. Whitman first adopted his method as something that came to him of its own motion. This is the best possible reason, and only possible excuse, for it. In its way, it is quite as artificial as that of any other poet, while it is unspeakably inartistic. On this account it is a failure. The method of talking to one's self in rhythmic and ecstatic prose is one that surprises at first, but, in the end, the talker can only have the devil for a listener, as happens in other cases when people address their own individualities; not, however, the devil of the proverb, but the devil of reasonless, hopeless, all-defying egotism. An ingenious French critic said very acutely of Mr. Whitman that he made you partner of the poetical enterprise, which is perfectly true; but no one wants to share the enterprise. We want its effect, its success; we do not want to plant corn, to hoe it, to drive the crows away, to gather it, husk it, grind it, sift it, bake it, and butter it, before eating it, and then take the risk of its being at last moldy in our mouths. And this is what you have to do in reading Mr. Whitman's rhythm.</p><p>At first, a favorable impression is made by the lawlessness of this poet, and one asks himself if this is not the form which the unconscious poetry of American life would take, if it could find a general utterance. But there is really no evidence that such is the case. It is certain that among the rudest peoples the lurking sublimity of nature has always sought expression in artistic form, and there is no good reason to believe that the sentiment of a people with our high average culture would seek expression more rude and formless than that of the savagest tribes. Is it not more probable that, if the passional principle of American life could find utterance, it would choose the highest, least dubious, most articulate speech? Could the finest, most shapely expression be too good for it?</p><p>If we are to judge the worth of Mr. Whitman's poetic theory (or impulse, or possession) by its popular success, we must confess that he is wrong. It is already many years since he first appeared with his claim of poet, and in that time he has employed criticism as much as any literary man in our country, and he has enjoyed the fructifying extremes of blame and praise. Yet he is, perhaps, less known to the popular mind, to which he has attempted to give an utterance, than the newest growth of the magazines and the newspaper notices. The people fairly rejected his former revelation, letter and spirit, and those who enjoyed it were readers with a cultivated taste for the quaint and the outlandish. The time to denounce or to ridicule Mr. Whitman for his first book is past. The case of 'Leaves of Grass' was long ago taken out [of] the hands of counsel and referred to the great jury. They have pronounced no audible verdict; but what does their silence mean? There were reasons in the preponderant beastliness of that book why a decent public should reject it; but now the poet has cleansed the old channels of their filth, and pours through them a stream of blameless purity, and the public has again to decide, and this time more directly, on the question of his poethood. As we said, his method remains the same, and he himself declares that, so far as concerns it, he has not changed nor grown in any way since we saw him last.</p><p>'Beginning my studies, the first step pleased me so much,<br>The mere fact, consciousness—these forms—the power of <br>motion.<br>The least insect or animal—the senses—eye-sight;<br>The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,<br>I have never gone, and never wish'd to go, any further,<br>But stop and loiter all my life to sing it in ecstatic <br>songs.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman has summed up his own poetical theory so well in these lines, that no criticism could possibly have done it better. It makes us doubt, indeed, if all we have said in consideration of him has not been said idly, and certainly releases us from further explanation of his method.</p><p>In 'Drum-Taps,' there is far more equality than in 'Leaves of Grass,' and though the poet is not the least changed in purpose, he is certainly changed in fact. The pieces of the new book are nearly all very brief, but generally his expression is freer and fuller than ever before. The reader understands, doubtless, from the title, that nearly all these pieces relate to the war; and they celebrate many of the experiences of the author in the noble part he took in the war. One imagines that burly tenderness of the man who went to supply the</p><p>'——lack of woman's nursing'</p><p>that there was in the hospitals of the field, and woman's tears creep unconsciously to the eyes as the pity of his heart communicates itself to his reader's. No doubt the pathos of many of the poems gains something from the quaintness of the poet's speech. One is touched in reading them by the same inarticulate feeling as that which dwells in music; and is sensible that the poet conveys to the heart certain emotions which the brain cannot analyze, and only remotely perceives. This is especially true of his inspirations from nature; memories and yearnings come to you folded, mute, and motionless in his verse, as they come in the breath of a familiar perfume. They give a strange, shadowy sort of pleasure, but they do not satisfy, and you rise from the perusal of this man's book as you issue from the presence of one whose personal magnetism is very subtle and strong, but who has not added to this tacit attraction the charm of spoken ideas. We must not mistake this fascination for a higher quality. In the tender eyes of an ox lurks a melancholy, soft and pleasing to the glance as the pensive sweetness of a woman's eyes; but in the orb of the brute there is no hope of expression, and in the woman's look there is the endless delight of history, the heavenly; possibility of utterance.</p><p>Art cannot greatly employ itself with things in embryo. The instinct of the beast may interest science; but poetry, which is nobler than science, must concern itself with natural instincts only as they can be developed into the sentiments and ideas of the soul of man. The mind will absorb from nature all that is speechless in her influences: and it will demand from kindred mind those higher things which can be spoken. Let us say our say here against the nonsense, long current, that there is, or can be, poetry between the lines, as is often sillily asserted. Expression will always suggest; but mere suggestion in art is unworthy of existence, vexes the heart, and shall not live. Every man has tender, and beautiful, and lofty emotions; but the poet was sent into this world to give these a tangible utterance, and if he do not this, but only give us back dumb emotion for dumb emotion, he is a cumberer of the earth. There is a yearning, almost to agony at times, in the human heart, to throw off the burden of inarticulate feeling, and if the poet will not help it in this effort, if, on the contrary, he shall seek to weigh it and sink it down under heavier burdens, he has not any reason to be.</p><p>So long, then, as Mr. Whitman chooses to stop at mere consciousness, he cannot be called a true poet. We all have consciousness; but we ask of art an utterance. We do not so much care in what way we get this expression; we will take it in ecstatic prose, though we think it is better subjected to the laws of prosody, since every good thing is subject to some law; but the expression we must have. Often, in spite of himself, Mr. Whitman grants it in this volume, and there is some hope that he will hereafter grant it more and more. There are such rich possibilities in the man that it is lamentable to contemplate his error of theory. He has truly and thoroughly absorbed the idea of our American life, and we say to him as he says to himself, 'You've got enough in you, Walt; why don't you get it out?' A man's greatness is good for nothing folded up in him, and if emitted in barbaric yawps, it is not more filling than Ossian or the east wind.</p><p>W. D. H. </p><p>∗ 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps.'

	"title": "Mr. Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p>MR. WALT WHITMAN.* </p><p>IT has been a melancholy task to read this book; and it is a still more melancholy one to write about it. Perhaps since the day of Mr. Tupper's 'Philosophy'1 there has been no more difficult reading of the poetic sort. It exhibits the effort of an essentially prosaic mind to lift itself, by a prolonged muscular strain, into poetry. Like hundreds of other good patriots, during the last four years, Mr. Walt Whitman has imagined that a certain amount of violent sympathy with the great deeds and sufferings of our soldiers, and of admiration for our national energy, together with a ready command of picturesque language, are sufficient inspiration for a poet. If this were the case, we had been a nation of poets. The constant developments of the war moved us continually to strong feeling and to strong expression of it. But in those cases in which these expressions were written out and printed with all due regard to prosody, they failed to make poetry, as any one may see by consulting now in cold blood the back volumes of the 'Rebellion Record.'2 Of course the city of Manhattan, as Mr. Whitman delights to call it, when regiments poured through it in the first months of the war, and its own sole god, to borrow the words of a real poet, ceased for a while to be the millionaire, was a noble spectacle, and a poetical statement to this effect is possible. Of course the tumult of a battle is grand, the results of a battle tragic, and the untimely deaths of young men a theme for elegies. But he is not a poet who merely reiterates these plain facts ore rotundo. He only sings them worthily who views them from a height. Every tragic event collects about it a number of persons who delight to dwell upon its superficial points—of minds which are bullied by the accidents of the affair. The temper of such minds seems to us to be the reverse of the poetic temper; for the poet, although he incidentally masters, grasps, and uses the superficial traits of his theme, is really a poet only in so far as he extracts its latent meaning and holds it up to common eyes. And yet from such minds most of our war-verses have come, and Mr. Whitman's utterances, much as the assertion may surprise his friends, are in this respect no exception to general fashion. They are an exception, however, in that they openly pretend to be something better; and this it is that makes them melancholy reading. Mr. Whitman is very fond of blowing his own trumpet, and he has made very explicit claims for his book. 'Shut not your doors,' he exclaims at the outset—</p><p>'Shut not your doors to me, proud libraries,<br>For that which was lacking among you all, yet needed most, I bring;<br>A book I have made for your dear sake, O soldiers,<br>And for you, O soul of man, and you, love of comrades;<br>The words of my book nothing, the life of it everything;<br>A book separate, not link'd with the rest, nor felt by the intellect;<br>But you will feel every word, O Libertad! arm'd Libertad!<br>It shall pass by the intellect to swim the sea, the air,<br>With joy with you, O soul of man.'</p><p>These are great pretensions, but it seems to us that the following are even greater:</p><p>'From Paumanok starting, I fly like a bird,<br>Around and around to soar, to sing the idea of all;<br>To the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs,<br>To Kanada, 'till I absorb Kanada in myself—to Michigan then,<br>To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs (they are inimitable);<br>Then to Ohio and Indiana, to sing theirs—to Missouri and Kansas and Arkansas to <br>sing theirs,<br>To Tennessee and Kentucky—to the Carolinas and Georgia, to sing theirs,<br>To Texas, and so along up toward California, to roam accepted everywhere;<br>To sing first (to the tap of the war-drum, if need be)<br>The idea of all—of the western world, one and inseparable,<br>And then the song of each member of these States.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman's primary purpose is to celebrate the greatness of our armies; his secondary purpose is to celebrate the greatness of the city of New York. He pursues these objects through a hundred pages of matter which remind us irresistibly of the story of the college professor who, on a venturesome youth's bringing him a theme done in blank verse, reminded him that it was not customary in writing prose to begin each line with a capital. The frequent capitals are the only marks of verse in Mr. Whitman's writing. There is, fortunately, but one attempt at rhyme. We say fortunately, for if the inequality of Mr. Whitman's lines were self-registering, as it would be in the case of an anticipated syllable at their close, the effect would be painful in the extreme. As the case stands, each line starts off by itself, in resolute independence of its companions, without a visible goal. But if Mr. Whitman does not write verse, he does not write ordinary prose. The reader has seen that liberty is 'libertad.' In like manner, comrade is 'camerado;' Americans are 'Americanos;' a pavement is a 'trottoir,' and Mr. Whitman himself is a 'chansonnier.' If there is one thing that Mr. Whitman is not, it is this, for Beranger3 was a chansonnier. To appreciate the force of our conjunction, the reader should compare his military lyrics with Mr. Whitman's declamations. Our author's novelty, however, is not in his words, but in the form of his writing. As we have said, it begins for all the world like verse and turns out to be arrant prose. It is more like Mr. Tupper's proverbs than anything we have met. But what if, in form, it is prose? it may be asked. Very good poetry has come out of prose before this. To this we would reply that it must first have gone into it. Prose, in order to be good poetry, must first be good prose. As a general principle, we know of no circumstance more likely to impugn a writer's earnestness than the adoption of an anomalous style. He must have something very original to say if none of the old vehicles will carry his thoughts. Of course he may be surprisingly original. Still, presumption is against him. If on examination the matter of his discourse proves very valuable, it justifies, or at any rate excuses, his literary innovation.</p><p>But if, on the other hand, it is of a common quality, with nothing new about it but its manners, the public will judge the writer harshly. The most that can be said of Mr. Whitman's vaticinations is, that, cast in a fluent and familiar manner, the average substance of them might escape unchallenged. But we have seen that Mr. Whitman prides himself especially on the substance—the life—of his poetry. It may be rough, it may be grim, it may be clumsy—such we take to be the author's argument—but it is sincere, it is sublime, it appeals to the soul of man, it is the voice of a people. He tells us, in the lines quoted, that the words of his book are nothing. To our perception they are everything, and very little at that. A great deal of verse that is nothing but words has, during the war, been sympathetically sighed over and cut out of newspaper corners, because it has possessed a certain simple melody. But Mr. Whitman's verse, we are confident, would have failed even of this triumph, for the simple reason that no triumph, however small, is won but through the exercise of art, and that this volume is an offense against art. It is not enough to be grim and rough and careless; common sense is also necessary, for it is by common sense that we are judged. There exists in even the commonest minds, in literary matters, a certain precise instinct of conservatism, which is very shrewd in detecting wanton eccentricities. To this instinct Mr. Whitman's attitude seems monstrous. It is monstrous because it pretends to persuade the soul while it slights the intellect; because it pretends to gratify the feelings while it outrages the taste. The point is that it does this on theory, wilfully, consciously, arrogantly. It is the little nursery game of 'open your mouth and shut your eyes.' Our hearts are often touched through a compromise with the artistic sense, but never in direct violation of it. Mr. Whitman sits down at the outset and counts out the intelligence. This were indeed a wise precaution on his part if the intelligence were only submissive! But when she is deliberately insulted, she takes her revenge by simply standing erect and open-eyed. This is assuredly the best she can do. And if she could find a voice she would probably address Mr. Whitman as follows: 'You came to woo my sister, the human soul. Instead of giving me a kick as you approach, you should either greet me courteously, or, at least, steal in unobserved. But now you have me on your hands. Your chances are poor. What the human heart desires above all is sincerity, and you do not appear to me sincere. For a lover you talk entirely too much about yourself. In one place you threaten to absorb Kanada. In another you call upon the city of New York to incarnate you, as you have incarnated it. In another you inform us that neither youth pertains to you nor 'delicatesse,' that you are awkward in the parlor, that you do not dance, and that you have neither bearing, beauty, knowledge, nor fortune. In another place, by an allusion to your 'little songs,' you seem to identify yourself with the third person of the Trinity. For a poet who claims to sing 'the idea of all,' this is tolerably egotistical. We look in vain, however, through your book for a single idea. We find nothing but flashy imitations of ideas. We find a medley of extravagances and commonplaces. We find art, measure, grace, sense sneered at on every page, and nothing positive given us in their stead. To be positive one must have something to say; to be positive requires reason, labor, and art; and art requires, above all things, a suppression of one's self, a subordination of one's self to an idea. This will never do for you, whose plan is to adapt the scheme of the universe to your own limitations. You cannot entertain and exhibit ideas; but, as we have seen, you are prepared to incarnate them. It is for this reason, doubtless, that when once you have planted yourself squarely before the public, and in view of the great service you have done to the ideal, have become, as you say, 'accepted everywhere,' you can afford to deal exclusively in words. What would be bald nonsense and dreary platitudes in any one else becomes sublimity in you. But all this is a mistake. To become adopted as a national poet, it is not enough to discard everything in particular and to accept everything in general, to amass crudity upon crudity, to discharge the undigested contents of your blotting-book into the lap of the public. You must respect the public which you address; for it has taste, if you have not. It delights in the grand, the heroic, and the masculine; but it delights to see these conceptions cast into worthy form. It is indifferent to brute sublimity. It will never do for you to thrust your hands into your pockets and cry out that, as the research of form is an intolerable bore, the shortest and most economical way for the public to embrace its idols—for the nation to realize its genius—is in your own person. This democratic, liberty-loving, American populace, this stern and war-tried people, is a great civilizer. It is devoted to refinement. If it has sustained a monstrous war, and practised human nature's best in so many ways for the last five years, it is not to put up with spurious poetry afterwards. To sing aright our battles and our glories it is not enough to have served in a hospital (however praiseworthy the task in itself), to be aggressively careless, inelegant, and ignorant, and to be constantly preoccupied with yourself. It is not enough to be rude, lugubrious, and grim. You must also be serious. You must forget yourself in your ideas. Your personal qualities—the vigor of your temperament, the manly independence of your nature, the tenderness of your heart—these facts are impertinent. You must be possessed, and you must strive to possess your possession. If in your striving you break into divine eloquence, then you are a poet. If the idea which possesses you is the idea of your country's greatness, then you are a national poet; and not otherwise.' </p><p>∗ 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps.' New York. 1865. </p>",

New-York. 1865.</p><p>Mr. WHITMAN has strong aspirations toward poetry, but he is wanting entirely in the qualities that PRAED 1 possessed in such large measure. He has no ear, no sense of the melody of verse. His poems only differ from prose in the lines being cut into length, instead of continuously pointed. As prose, they must be gauged by the sense they contain, the mechanism of verse being either despised by, or out of the reach of the writer. Considered as prose, then, we find in them a poverty of thought, paraded forth with a hubbub of stray words, and accompanied with a vehement self-assertion in the author, that betrays an absence of true and calm confidence in himself and his impulses. Mr. WHITMAN has fortunately better claims on the gratitude of his countrymen than any he will ever derive from his vocation as a poet. What a man does, is of far greater consequence than what he says or prints, and his devotion to the most painful of duties in the hospitals at Washington during the war, will confer honor on his memory when Leaves of Grass are withered and Drum Taps have ceased to vibrate.</p>",

	"body": "<p>'Drum Taps.'</p><p>Walt Whitman's title is well enough chosen, for it is odd, and it bears no clear relation to the contents of his book, and in this oddness and apparent incoherency it resembles much in the book. We have no mind to laugh at Whitman's poetry. We know that for four years of war he has done noble and beautiful service in the hospitals, bending his shaggy form to a thousand little offices of kindness and shrinking from nothing. But he is not a poet, if we know what a poet is.</p><p>We have supposed that, without imagination, without music, without any revelation of either the beautiful or the sublime, without any intimate and pervading connection between the form and the substance, there could be no poetry. Strong feeling is something, and a keen appreciation of the picturesque and impressive in nature is something, but they alone cannot furnish forth poetry any more than two strings can fitly make a harp. Walt Whitman has these two, and the jagged and battered frame of the instrument he calls his verse holds little else. He is a fervent patriot, a hearty lover of the soldier, a keen, cordial sympathizer with nature, feeling the flow of its kindred currents with vigor and freshness; and he is a thorough rough, but not a singer. It is an easy thing for one who, in camps and marches, on the field of battle and by the side of sick or wounded men, has seen the soldier's heroism, patience, pluck, and simple, sublime repose in his cause and his God—for one who has seen and felt the romance of the war and its strange incidents, its unpainted and unspoken scenes—to think that the unaccustomed tide of feeling which fires the brain and compels the heart, and lights the eye and deepens the voice and hurries the pen and quickens human sympathy wherever it is looked or spoken, is the inspiration of the poet. But when it is this, and nothing more, it is not inspiration, and it results in Walt Whitman in something which—in spite of its grotesque form and occasional sonorous lines and frequent thrilling passages—is commonplace, and must sooner or later die a commonplace's dreary death.</p><p>In our opinion, moreover, this old friend of ours sins in more than the very common mistake of supposing that poetry which is not. He falls into the fatal error of supposing and acting and writing on the supposition that he is, on the whole, the most completely original, authoritative, and indisputable critic of this world and its contents, vain and otherwise, that a hitherto stingy Providence has vouchsafed. In such cases there is generally one safe disposition for the resulting criticism, and that is a hasty consignment to oblivion. But Mr. Whitman deserves more of us, for though he insists that inherently there is no doubt of his vast elevation above the rest of mankind, he is so sturdily good-natured in his assumption, so really sincere in his rapturous self-worship, and so familiar with the ways and words of the world he despises, very weak or a very wicked devotee at his own shrine. The fact is that, with ample chances to be at least a sensible writer, he chooses to be the opposite; and along with some broken, distorted, unfinished thoughts on life and the war, and man and Manhattan, he pours upon us an intolerable flood of Whitman in its crude state and most comfortless forms.</p><p>Mr. Whitman will hardly be a poet in this world if 'Drum Taps' are his best; and we doubt if any man who could be guilty of some of these can be a poet in any world where harmony and beauty in thought and expression are attributes of poetry</p>",

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN'S DRUM TAPS, Bunce & Huntington, New York.</p><p>It is hard to criticise the book of a friend. Walt Whitman is a brawny, sensitive, brave, tender-hearted man, with untrimmed beard and broad shoulders, but as gentle as a girl. He felt the workings of a quaint sort of afflatus years ago, and wrote 'Leaves of Grass,' which Emerson said was 'the best thing America has yet produced,' but which, per contra, prompted Salmon P. Chase to say in a burst of disgust, 'he ought to be hanged for it.' Now he brings out 'Drum Taps' in the same style—a sort of poetic madness without a method. It is little to say of it that it is a bold defiance of good taste, for that is just what it claims to be. It does not merely undertake to subordinate the mind to the feelings, but to ignore the intellectual and æsthetic altogether. This book, like Leaves of Grass, consists in disjointed exclamations with no attempt at either rhyme or meter—ten thousand unfinished sentences with ten thousand exclamation points at the end. We give a sample.</p><p>'Race of veterans!<br>Race of the soil ready for conflict! race of the conquering march!<br>(No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race!)<br>Race of passion and the storm.'</p><p>That is the whole of one poem! Is there any sense in it?</p><p>'Silent and amazed, even when a little boy,<br>I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his statements,<br>As contending against some being or influence.'</p><p>That is the whole of another! What shall we say of this person?—that he is an idiot? No; for he is a refined and educated gentleman, an agreeable companion, something of a scholar. Shall we reckon his publishers fools? Hardly; for they sold a large edition of 'Leaves of Grass' which was not a whit better. Moreover, that was justly offensive for its impurities of thought and expression, and there was talk of suppressing it for its immorality. Yet from personal acquaintance we believe Walt Whitman to be a pure man. He is delicate and thoroughly conscientious. He expended the money which he received for 'Leaves of Grass' in the most devoted ministrations to the wounded soldiers during the war, and they loved him as if he had been a mother, and he bore them in his strong arms with the fidelity of an elder brother. He is a moral man; but 'Leaves of Grass' has a bad tendency. He is a learned man, but 'Drum Taps' is utterly without any continous sense, or else an intelligent public is very addle-headed.</p>",

He will also be impressed with the fact that the author is possessed of much poetic feeling; but yet will scarcely be convinced that the disjointed prose of 'Drum-taps' is entitled to be considered as poetry. There is a sense in which we speak of the poetry of the clouds-formless, voiceless as they are. In a somewhat similar sense 'Drum-taps' may be called poetry. The lines therein contained, while they are as ragged and broken as the storm-cloud, and as destitute-many of them-of any intelligible utterance, yet leave with the reader a vague sense of poetic exaltation. Undoubtedly, the author has capabilities. There are passages in the lines entitled 'Captain, My Captain,' and in the war-lyric commencing 'Beat, beat, drums,' that give abundant evidence that Walt Whitman could write true poetry if he would only consent to write either rhyme or reason. His absurd theories of composition have hitherto prevented him from doing either, except at the rarest intervals.</p>",

	"body": "<p>(For the Saturday Press.)</p><p>'DRUM-TAPS.'</p><p>———</p><p>Few persons, we imagine, have read the much over-praised, as well as greatly underrated writings of Walt Whitman, without a conviction that their author is a genuine poet, although they may not agree with his more enthusiastic critics in ranking him above all of the moderns, and finding his true place beside Isaiah, Ezekiel and Job. It is impossible to sympathize heartily with the greatest thoughts that have found utterance in literature, and not to admire; him. The two ideas which have him in their possession,—the omnipresence of; the soul, and the sacredness of the individual—lie at the roots of poetry and civilization; and he chants them with an invincible faith, which is, of itself, sufficient to place him on a plane beyond that of the poets who believe in art as a finality.</p><p>But to be a Pantheist and a Democrat, does not constitute a claim sufficient to entitle any man to the distinction of being a great poet; and Walt Whitman has no other, save a picturesqueness of phrase unsurpassed in literature, and a powerful rhythm, whose long musical roll is like that of the waves of the sea. For he is not a man of ideas. What is called his sanity, his tenacious grasp on realities, is, after all, the monomania of a man whom a great thought has robbed of his self-possession. The unity of the soul is a key that unlocks all doors, but Walt Whitman stopped at the first one to which he applied it. He celebrates the divinity of matter, and worships the shells of things with such fervor that he almost persuades us that there is no substance behind them. It is a dangerous error. The sphinx, Matter, stands in her terrible beauty before every soul, and no answer to her riddle is more fatal than this. Whisper to her that she is divine, and her smiling lips open surely for your destruction. The idea which led Oriental thinkers to the life of contemplation, and which gives Emerson a serenity like that of the unclouded summer sky, leads this poet to materialism. His songs, though beautiful and inspiring, smack too strongly of the earth. His suggestions are sometimes vast, but himself is chaotic and fragmentary. The truth is that the two ideas which find expression through him are antagonistic. Because the soul is one and all mighty, the individual is nothing. 'I want no masses at all,' says Emerson; but in Whitman the passion for individuals is so strong that it continually wrestles with and overthrows his belief in the universal. Democracy is a good thought to found a state upon, but it is not the profoundest basis for a poem.</p><p>Jefferson may claim that 'all men are born free and equal,' and Whitman may 'accept nothing which all cannot have the counterpart of on the same terms;' but the soul, which does not divide itself impartially through the whole universe, but incarnates itself wholly in each atom, is an aristocrat—does not whiffle about rights and duties—claims all and will not be hindered of its own. Mr. Gradgrind's facts, Walt Whitman's patriotism, the vilest man, the purest saint, are equally sacred, and equally valueless, for they are the stepping- stones only, to the unattainable beyond. Let any man assume the attitude of adoration, no matter how fair the shrine, and his shell instantly hardens around him. And porous as this poet thinks himself to all the influences of the universe, he is prostrated, deaf, dumb and blind, before an idol from which the god has departed.</p><p>And yet, as Thoreau said, he suggests at times something more than human. In his latest volume there are a few passages which contain the very essence of poetry, and are inexpressibly pathetic, moreover, with the yearning humanity that breathes through them. Setting aside his war chants, which are remarkable for nothing but the startling vividness of their pictures, there are certain poems which make one doubt the correctness of the impression made by the whole man. Such, for instance, are the invocation to Death in the poem called 'When last in the dooryard the lilacs bloomed [sic],' 'Chanting the Square Deific,' and 'As I lay with my head in your lap.' If his faith in the unseen were more of a prophetic fury, and less a premeditated and coolly considered belief; if he clung closer to realities and less tenaciously to appearances, he would be the greatest poet of our day. But he hesitates, as he says, with a rare self-appreciation, at the first step in his progress. He shuts himself from hearty sympathy on all sides. His music, his picturesque force avail him little with the poets, while he so persistently produces poetical effects outside of the accepted rules of their art; and his vast ideas fail of half their force to those who, believing in them as faithfully as he, feel that his application of them is limited and material.</p><p>F.</p>",

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN's DRUM TAPS New York, 1865. (Pp. 96.)</p><p>Such is the title of the latest volume of poems by a man of singular genius, Mr. Walter Whitman, of Brooklyn, N. Y. lately displaced from a humble clerkship in Washington by the husband of Mrs. Harlan. In it is included also a smaller collection of verses, called 'Sequel to Drum Taps,' and containing chiefly poems which relate to the death of President Lincoln and the close of the war. The poems called Drum Taps, as the name indicates, relate mostly to the beginning and the progress of the war. Before noticing at any length either these poems or their author, let us make a little comparison which is not without significance.</p><p>Mr. Whitman is a native of New York, a staunch patriot, and through the war, by his services to our soldiers in camp and hospital, has earned the gratitude of tens of thousands of the men who fought and died for their country. He has tenderly cared for the wounded, nursed the sick, consoled the dying and buried the dead. This he did not for pay or for glory—for he got neither—but for love of the sacred cause of freedom and of mankind. He had previously been known to many of his countrymen as a poet of original powers, occupied with the most important themes, which he did not always treat in conformity to the preconceived opinions of the multitude. Having served in his chosen work through the war, both before and after his appointment and dismissal from a clerkship at Washington, he sought in his native city a publisher for his patriotic verses, but he found none willing to put his name to the volume. Messrs. Bunce & Huntington finally printed it, but without their name, and without taking any of customary steps to introduce the book to the reading public. It is scarcely to be got at a bookstore, has hardly been noticed by a newspaper, and, though full of the noblest verses, is utterly unknown to the mass of readers.</p><p>Now, look at another fact. Mr. John Esten Cooke is a Virginian, who early joined the rebellion, in which his State played so prominent a part. He served in the army, and did his noble best to destroy the government and kill our brave soldiers. Being a writer, too, he aided his sword by his pen; and by what passes in Virginia for fine writing, he encouraged his fellow-traitors to prolong their treason. He had been known at the North, too, before the war, as a writer of trashy verses and sensational fiction.</p><p>Whether Mr. Cooke was pardoned by President Johnson at the urgency of Mrs. Cobb, or whether he is still unpardoned, (if he ever rose to the rank which made a pardon necessary,) we do not know. But he has had the effrontery to come to New York with a fourth-rate novel, written in the style of Mrs. Henry Wood, but full of the rankest treason and laudation of traitors, and he, too, has needed a publisher. But he did not wait long. Messrs. Bunce & Huntington, the same who treat Mr. Whitman so cavalierly, are eager to put his trash into the market. They announce it months in advance; they advertise it in all the newspapers; they send advance copies and secure long notices in the leading journals. The Advertiser devotes nearly a column to it; the Evening Post notices it at some length; the Round Table blows a trumpet before and behind it; and other journals pay it the courtesy of a serious review. Yet neither the author nor the book have any merit to be compared with Tupper and the Country Parson, while both are full of the vilest political heresy and bad taste.</p><p>This is the way we encourage poets and patriots; this is the way we reward them, and make treason odious!</p><p>Yet this displaced and slighted poet has written the most touching dirge for Abraham Lincoln of all that have appeared. Here it is copied from [the] volume before us:—</p><p><em>O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!</em><br>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br>The ship has weathered every rock, the prize we sought <br>is won.<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all <br>exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim <br>and daring;</p><p>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot,<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the <br>bells;<br>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the <br>bugle trills;<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths—for you <br>the shores a-crowding;<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager<br> faces turning;</p><p>O Captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you;<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and <br>still,<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse <br>nor will;<br>But the ship, the ship, is anchored safe, its voyage <br>closed and done;<br>From fearful trip, the victor ship comes in with <br>object won.</p><p>Exult O shore, and ring O bells!<br>But I with mournful tread<br>Walk the spot my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>Compare with this, for poetic or pathetic feeling, Brownell's long monody, and the other good verses, and how superior that man's suggestive treatment.</p><p>We have quoted perhaps the most effective [illegible] poem in the book; but there are lines or passages in nearly all which are very striking. In the first poem, for instance, which gives its name to the volume, he describes the arming of New York when the news came of the attack on Fort [illegible]. 'The Lady of this teeming and turbulent city' calls forth her children as bees are called from the hive. She,</p><p>'At dead of night, at news from the South,<br>Incensed, struck with clenched hand the pave-<br>ment,—<br>A shock electric—the night sustained it,<br>Till with ominous hum, our hive at daybreak poured <br>out its myriads.'</p><p>One of the longer poems opens thus, with a melodious verse which yet does not come under any of the rules for English prosody:—</p><p>'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,<br>And the great star early drooped in the western <br>sky in the night,<br>I mourned—and yet shall mourn with ever retur-<br>ning spring.'</p><p>In the 'Dirge for Two Veterans' are these stanzas:—</p><p>'I see a sad procession,<br>And I hear the sound of coming full-keyed bugles;<br>All the channels of the city streets they're flooding<br>As with voices and with tears.</p><p>I hear the great drums pounding,<br>And the small drums steady whirring;<br>And every blow of the great convulsive drum<br>Strikes me through and through.</p><p>Now nearer blow the bugles,<br>And the drums strike more convulsively;<br>And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,<br>And the strong dead-march enwraps me.'</p><p>We have quoted enough to show the power which this poet has to fix his thought in the mind at a single stroke. But what cannot so well be shown by quotations is the broad effect of his poems as a whole; as he says himself,</p><p>'The words of my book nothing, the life of it <br>everything.'</p><p>He has the power which Crawford had in sculpture, and which Church has in painting, of producing in his own way the feeling that the American landscape produces,—a vast and vague delight in the scope of existence on this western hemisphere. This was manifest in Leaves of Grass, but it is still more so here, where the sentiment is more concentrated by the national crisis in which the poems were written.</p><p>Like many of our best poets, however, he is too wilful, and does not conform himself with sufficient patience to the laws of rhythm and proportion in thought or expression. Consequently he is fitfully great, and pleases only at intervals in the details of his composition. He is often as tiresome as Wordsworth in his dull passages, and as rugged as an old English metrical romance. He is full of other faults, too, but they mostly spring from his wilfulness and impatience of rules.</p><p>The complaints made of his earlier poems, that they were coarse and immoral in passages, will not apply to this little volume, which is as free from reproach on this score as Mr. Harlan's hymn-book. It will do much, we are confident, to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds, and to secure him that place in literature during his lifetime which he is sure to hold in the next age.</p>",

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN'S DRUM-TAPS.*</p><p>SAID Thoreau: 'The wisest definition of poetry the poet will instantly prove false by setting aside its requisitions.' This acute observation has never been more strikingly proved than by the author of the volume before us. The curious and the metaphysical have frequently essayed a complete and accurate definition of the word poetry; but it would be impossible to locate within any of their survey-bills, the strange pastures into which Walt Whitman leads his flocks. And yet the author of 'Leaves of Grass,' is as unquestionably a true poet, as the greatest of his contemporaries. He seems to us more purely permeated with the subtile essence of poetry than almost any other. It is the air he breathes: the very blood of his arteries. With others there are wide vistas of unmitigated prose in their view of life; to this poet, everything in the world is glowing with poetic beauty. Objects which seem so insignificant—so homely and common-place to most of us, he weaves into his poems. We would not, of course, be understood to say that a simple photography of whatever objects pass before us answers the ends of art. The hand which holds the pencil is everything; and all must be so portrayed that we view them from the poet's own high stand-point. This answers the artistic end; and it is vain to deny artistic treatment in Walt Whitman's poems because they are not constructed in accordance with canons previously laid down. The true poet discovers new and unsuspected laws of art, and makes his own rules. If he touches the secret chords of poetry in our soul, that is the only test, whether we can explain it to our own understanding or not.</p><p>'Drum-Taps' contains but few strikingly different characteristics from the author's former volume. We are pleased to find that certain features of that are not introduced in this; for we are compelled to confess that there were certain pages of the 'Leaves of Grass' which we regretted had been written. We have written upon the fly-leaf of our copy this passage from 'The Essays:' 'Osmand had a humanity so broad and deep, that although his speech was so bold and free with the Koran as to disgust all the dervishes, yet was there never a poor outcast, eccentric or insane man, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had been mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his brain, but fled at once to him: that great heart lay there so sunny and hospitable in the centre of the country, that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers drew them to his side.'</p><p>On looking through the pages of 'Drum-Taps,' and catching the soft and sweet strains of a sublime tenderness, much more than the martial music which the title indicates, certain scenes in Washington in the winter of '63 and '64 recur very vividly to memory; his meeting soldiers on the street whom he had nursed and tended—</p><p>'Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested—<br>Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips',—</p><p>walks with him through some of the hospitals, where he came a ministering spirit, daily. It was very affecting to witness the adoration which this divine love kindled. And it was somewhat amusing, too, to discover certain little myths which were afloat from bed to bed concerning him, for he was not known among them as writer or poet, and there seemed to be some mystery attached to his mission.</p><p>In this brief notice we have left little space for some extracts which we proposed to give.

	"body": "<p>WALT WHITMAN AND HIS 'DRUM TAPS.'</p><p>———</p><p>CONSIDERING the amount of adverse criticism that has been aimed at Walt Whitman for the last ten years, and the apparent security with which the public rests in the justness of its verdict concerning him, it certainly cannot be damaging to the cause of literature in America, where discussion and agitation in all things are the need of every hour, for us to set up a claim, in a mild way, illustrated by his recent publication called 'Drum Taps,' more favorable to this rejected and misinterpreted poet.</p><p>Moreover, the beautiful benevolence he has shown during the war in nourishing the sick and wounded soldiers, and his great love and humanity as exhibited in this little volume, entitle him, on grounds of justice alone, to more respect and consideration than he has hitherto received at the hands of his countrymen. He has been sneered at and mocked and ridiculed; he has been cursed and caricatured and persecuted, and instead of retorting in a like strain, or growing embittered and misanthropic, he has preserved his serenity and good nature under all, and illustrated the doctrine of charity he has preached by acts of the most pure and disinterested benevolence. Walt Whitman was born on Long Island, N. Y., in the Spring of 1819, and boasts that his tongue and every atom of his blood was formed from this soil, this air. 'Born here of parents born here, from parents the same and their parents' parents the same,' and hence, physiologically, is American to the very marrow of his bones.</p><p>On his father's side, his stock is English; on his mother's, Holland Dutch. From his father he inherits his large frame and muscular build—his antecedents here being a race of farmers and mechanics, silent, good-natured, playing no high part in society, politics or the church, and noted chiefly for strength and size. His early life was passed partly in Brooklyn and partly in the country about forty miles east of Brooklyn, where he lived much in presence of the sea. Between the ages of seventeen and twenty he seems to have been mostly engaged in teaching country schools in his native town and vicinity. It was about this time that he began writing for the press. His first productions, mostly sketches, appeared in the 'Democratic Review,' from which they were copied into some of the newspapers. Between the ages of twenty and thirty, he was variously occupied as writer and editor on the press of New York and Brooklyn, sometimes going into the country and delivering political addresses. During this period he was on familiar terms of acquaintance with William Cullen Bryant, and the two were in the habit of taking long walks, which, of course, were equivalent to long talks, in and about Brooklyn. In 1850 he went to New Orleans in the capacity of editor, where he remained a year. On his trip to and from that city he made it a point to penetrate various parts of the West and Southwest, particularly to explore the Mississippi and its tributaries, searching, one might say, for hints and models to be used in the making of his poems.</p><p>He does not seem to have conceived the idea of writing 'Leaves of Grass' till after his thirtieth year. How he was led to adopt this style of expression, thoroughly versed as he was in the literature of the day, is uncertain. The most probable explanation is, that he felt hampered by the old forms and measures, and saw that if America ever came to possess a style of her own it would be in the direction of more freedom and scope—a feeling in which many of his contemporaries are beginning to share. For three or four years before he began to write in this vein, and while his loaf was leavening, as it were, he was a diligent student of the critical literature of the age, delving into foreign magazines and quarterly reviews, and collecting together a vast amount of matter, bearing upon poetry and literature generally, for further use and study. It is quite probable that this course of reading had some influence in determining his own course as a poet, and that he knew well beforehand wherein the head and front of his offending would lie. It has not been with his eyes shut that he set himself squarely against the popular taste and standards, and wrote for an audience of which he did not count upon the present existence of a single member. It cannot be said with the same force of any other writer, living or dead, that he must 'wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of himself.'</p><p>When 'Leaves of Grass' was written and published, the author was engaged in putting up small frame houses in the suburbs of Brooklyn, partly with his own hands and partly with hired help. The book was still-born. To a small job printing office in that city belongs the honor, if such, of bringing it to light. Some three score copies were deposited in a neighboring book store, and as many more in another book store in New York. Weeks elapsed and not one was sold. Presently there issued requests from both the stores that the thin quarto, for such it was, should be forthwith removed. The copies found refuge in a well-known phrenological publishing house in Broadway, whose proprietors advertised it and sent specimen copies to the journals and to some distinguished persons. The journals remained silent, and several of the volumes sent to the distinguished persons were returned with ironical and insulting notes. The only attention the book received was, for instance, the use of it by the collected attachés of a leading daily paper of New York, when at leisure, as a butt and burlesque—its perusal aloud by one of the party being equivalent to peals of ironical laughter from the rest.</p><p>A small but important occurrence seems to have turned the tide. This was the appearance of a letter from the most illustrious literary man in America, brief, but containing a magnificent eulogium of the book. A demand arose, and before many months all the copies of the thin quarto were sold. At the present date, a curious person, poring over the shelves of second-hand book stalls in side places of the city, may light upon a copy of this quarto, for which the stall-keeper will ask him treble its first price. 'Leaves of Grass,' considerably added to, and printed in the new shape of a handy 16mo. of about 350 pages, again appeared in 1857. This edition also sold. The newspaper notices of it both here and in Great Britain were numerous, and nearly all of them scoffing, bitter and condemnatory. The most general charge made was that it had passages of serious indelicacy.</p><p>For the third time, now much enlarged and in a really beautiful typography and accompaniments, these 'Leaves' were issued in Boston as a 12mo. of 456 pages, in 1860. This is their last appearance. An edition of several thousand was taken up, but the business panic of the year, joined with the war, broke down the publishing house that had the book in hand, and the stereotype plates were locked up in chancery. We understand, however, that a new edition is now (August) in the hands of the printer and will shortly be given to the public. This edition will include 'Drum Taps,' and show many changes, both in the text and arrangement of the other poems, and indicate much more clearly the purpose or idea of the poet than any edition heretofore published. The entire carrying out of his plan, however, still contemplates the addition of a series of short pieces, like those called 'Calamus,' expressive of the religious sentiment and aspiration of man.</p><p>The full history of the book, if it could ever be written, would be a very curious one. No American work has ever before excited at once such diametrically opposite judgments, some seeing in it only matter for ridicule and contempt; others, eminent in the walks of literature, regarding it as a great American poem. Its most enthusiastic champions are young men, and students and lovers of nature; though the most pertinent and suggestive criticism of it we have ever seen, and one that accepted it as a whole, was by a lady—one whose name stands high on the list of our poets. Some of the poet's warmest personal friends, also, are women of this mould. On the other hand, the most bitter and vindictive critic of him of whom we have heard was a Catholic priest, who evoked no very mild degree of damnation upon his soul; if, indeed, we except the priestly official at the seat of government who, in administering the affairs of his department, on what he had the complacency to call Christian principles, took occasion, for reason of the poet's literary heresies alone, to expel him from a position in his office. Of much more weight than the opinion of either of these Christian gentlemen is the admiration of that Union soldier we chanced to hear of, who by accident came into possession of the book, and without any previous knowledge of it or its author, and by the aid of his mother wit alone, came to regard it with feelings akin to those which personal friendship and intercourse alone awaken; carrying it in his knapsack through three years of campaigning on the Potomac, and guarding it with a sort of jealous affection from the hands of his comrades.</p><p>It certainly is an astounding book; but if one will face it fairly, it is by no means so hopeless as it would seem. If the book as a whole means anything, it means power, health, freedom, democracy, self-esteem, a full life in the open air, an escape from the old forms and standards, and a declaration for new and enlarged modes, not only in letters, but in life. In other words, 'Leaves of Grass' is the expression in literature of a perfectly healthy, unconventional man; not an abstract, or an intellectual statement of him merely, but the full rendering of a human personality for better or for worse. The poet celebrates himself, that is, uses himself, as an illustration of the character upon which his book is predicated, and which he believes to be typical of the American of the future. This character he has mapped out in bold, strong lines, and in its interest has written his poems. Hence it is not for the man of to-day he has spoken; he has discarded the man of today as effete—has rejected his models and standards, and spoken for what he believes to be the man of the future. He must, therefore, have been well prepared for the reception he has met with. Is it to be expected that current conventionalities will endorse him who seeks their overthrow? If we see correctly, the book is also a terrible reaction against the petty, dainty, drivelling ways into which literature has fallen.</p><p>But to return to our account of the poet himself. Contrary to the hasty opinions of the critics, who mistook the personal element in his poems and their unliterary spirit (the spirit of nature and life is always unliterary) as evidence of the want of culture in their author, he is a man deeply learned in all the great literatures of the world. The Greek dramatists he has read as few moderns have, and knows Homer to his finger ends. The sects and commentators have not spoilt for him that greatest of books, the Bible, which he always has near. And his mastery of the German metaphysicians has not barred his mind to the enjoyment of the other extreme of literature; the stores of ballad poetry, as the Spanish songs of the 'Cid,'1 and Walter Scott's 'Border Minstrelsy,'2 which last is a source of never-failing delight to him. Considering how the critics have fathered him on Emerson, it is valuable to know that he did not make the acquaintance of Emerson's mind till after the publication of the first edition of his poems. Going, as was his wont, to spend a long Summer day by the sea-shore on Coney Island, in those years a place entirely uninhabited, he carried with him in the basket that contained his dinner, three volumes of 'Emerson's Essays,' which a friend had recommended to him. There, on that solitary beach fronting the sea, he that day, for the first time, read Emerson.</p><p>But he has been a reader of men and of things, and a student of America, much more than of books. Fond of cities, he has gone persistently into all their haunts and by-places, not as a modern missionary and reformer, but as a student and lover of men, finding beneath all forms of vice and degradation the same old delicious, yearning creatures, after all.</p><p>Lethargic during an interview, passive and receptive, an admirable listener, never in a hurry, with the air of one who has plenty of leisure, always in perfect repose, imple and direct in manners, a lover of plain, common people, 'meeter of savage and gentleman on equal terms,' temperate, chaste, sweet-breathed, tender and affectionate, of copious friendship, preferring always to meet as flesh and blood, and with a large, summery, motherly soul that shines in all his ways and looks, he is by no means the 'rough' people have been so willing to believe. Fastidious as a high caste Brahmin in his food and personal neatness and cleanliness, well dressed, with a gray, open throat, a deep, sympathetic voice, a kind, genial look, the impression he makes upon you is that of the best blood and breeding. He reminds one of the first men—the beginners; has a primitive, out-door look—not so much from being in the open air as from the texture and quality of his make—a look as of the earth, the sea, or the mountains, and 'is usually taken,' says a late champion of his cause, 'for some great mechanic, or stevedore, or seaman, or grand laborer of one kind or another.' His physiognomy presents very marked features—features of the true antique pattern, almost obsolete in modern faces—seen in the strong, square bridge of his nose, his high arching brows, and the absence of all bulging in his forehead, a face approximating in type to the statued Greek. He does not mean intellect merely, but life; and one feels that he must arrive at his results rather by sympathy and absorption than by hard intellectual processes; by the effluence of power rather than by direct and total application of it. In keeping with this, his poems do not have the character of carefully elaborated specimens—of gems cut and polished by the intellect, but are warm and vascular, like living organisms.</p><p>In the matter of health he is an exception to most known instances. He presents the rare phenomenon of a man giving himself to intellectual labor without suffering the slightest detriment to his physical powers; never knowing dyspepsia, nervousness, ennui, and an entire stranger to headache until his presence in the army hospitals, and his stopping too long consecutively after the battles of the Wilderness, with a collection of gangrened wounds, had inoculated his system with a malignant virus. And this robust bodily health, as we have said, is one key to his poems. The peculiar quality of them—a quality as of the open air, the woods, the shore, we believe to be more or less attributable to this source. The absence of all pettiness, dallying and sentimentalism, follows from a like cause.</p><p>We need not praise him for his patriotism, yet was there ever such a lover of country? He has trailed its entire geography through his poems, courteously saluted every city, great and small, celebrated every phase of its life, the habits of its people, their trades, tools, employments, etc.; has tallied in his poems its vast mass movements, and has not merely predicted, but unhesitatingly counted upon, a future greatness for it absolutely unparalleled in the history of the world.</p><p>Soon after the breaking out of the Rebellion, he was drawn to the seat of war to look after a wounded brother3—a captain in one of the New York regiments -and since that time has been engaged in field and hospital in nourishing the sick and wounded soldiers. Up to a very recent date he was still quietly but steadily occupied in the same ministrations among the few worst specimens that lingered in the hospitals about Washington.</p><p>His theory seems to have been that what the soldiers—many of them becoming worse, and even dying of sheer home-sickness—most needed, was a fresh, cheerful countenance, a strong, hopeful voice, and the atmosphere and presence of a loving and healthy friend. Hence he went among them purely in the spirit of love, distributing small gifts—sometimes of money, books, or papers, sometimes of fruits, delicacies, or special food—now reading aloud to a listening group, now soothing by his presence the worst, and, may be, last moments of some poor sufferer. Many soldiers can be found who aver that he saved their lives out and out. His mere presence was tonic and invigorating.</p><p>The book called 'Drum Taps,' which is the result of the poet's experience in the army and in the hospitals, and to which we propose to devote the remainder of this article, is a little volume of less than a hundred pages, full of warlike passion, singularly blended with as much sadness, perhaps, as was ever printed in a like space.</p><p>Those who know Walt Whitman will not be surprised at his calmness and good nature under the treatment awarded to his previous book, and that he should still display the same confidence in himself, and determination to 'fight it out on that line' that he evinced at first.</p><p>I am more resolute because all have denied me that I could ever have been had all <br>accepted me; I heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities, <br>nor ridicule.</p><p>Yet, on the whole, the sadness and solemnity of 'Drum Taps' contrasts strongly with the flushed, exultant, arrogant, fore-noon spirit of 'Leaves of Grass.' Here the thought is of death and suffering, and of the desolation of hearts.</p><p>Though his themes are mostly suggested by our recent war, yet it is evidently not the purpose of the poet to give descriptions of battles and of great campaigns, or to celebrate great leaders and brilliant achievements; but rather to give the human aspects of anguish that follow in the train of war. He has looked deeper into the matter than the critics are willing to believe. He perhaps feels that the permanent condition of modern society is that of peace; that war, as a business, as a means of growth, has served its time, and that, notwithstanding the vast difference between ancient and modern warfare, both in the spirit and in the means, Homer's pictures are essentially true yet, and no additions to them can be made. War can never be to us what it was to Greece, Rome, and, indeed, to the nations of all ages down to the present; never the main fact—the paramount condition, tyrannizing over all the affairs of national and individual life; but only an episode, a passing interruption; and the poet who in our day would be as true to his nation and times as Homer was to his, must treat of it from the standpoint of peace and progress, and even benevolence. Vast armies rise up in a night and disappear in a day—half a million of men, inured to battle and to blood, go back to the avocations of peace without a moment's confusion or delay—indicating clearly the tendency that prevails.</p><p>Also, in obedience to the true democratic spirit, which is the spirit of the times, the attention of the poet is not drawn to the army as a unit—as a tremendous power wielded by a single will, but to the private soldier, the man in the ranks, from the farm, the shop, the mill, the mine, still a citizen engaged in the sacred warfare of peace. Always and always the individual, this is the modern doctrine, as opposed to slavery and caste and the results of the feudal world.</p><p>Hence those of the poet's friends who expected to find in this little volume all the 'pomp and circumstance of glorious war' have been disappointed. Apostrophizing the genius of America, he says:</p><p>No poem proud I chanting bring to thee—nor mastery's rapturous verse;<br>But a little book containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,<br>And psalms of the dead.</p><p>His aim does not permit of the slightest expression of partisan or sectional feeling, or any exultation over a fallen foe. Under the head of 'Reconciliation' are these lines:</p><p>Word over all, beautiful as the sky:<br>Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly lost;<br>That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly, softly wash again, and ever <br>again, this soil'd world;<br>For my enemy is dead—a man divine as myself is dead;<br>I look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin—I draw near;<br>I bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.</p><p>The following lines express with great vividness and force the feeling in which all true patriots shared during the second year of the war:</p><p>Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!<br>Your Summer wind was warm enough—yet the air I breathed froze me;<br>A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me;<br>Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself;<br>Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?<br>And sullen hymns of defeat?</p><p>The poem on page 71 is so full of an overmastering pathos; and displays so well the poet's peculiar method and spirit, that we give it entire:</p><p>Pensive, on her dead gazing, I heard the Mother of All,<br>Desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle-fields gazing;<br>As she call’d to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk’d:<br>Absorb them well, O my earth, she cried—I charge you, lose not my sons! lose not an <br>atom;</p><p>And you streams, absorb them well, taking their dear blood;<br>And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly,<br>And all you essences of soil and growth—and you, my rivers’ depths;<br>And you, mountain sides—and the woods where my dear children’s blood, trickling, <br>redden’d;</p><p>And you trees, down in your roots, to bequeath to all future trees,<br>My dead absorb—my young men’s beautiful bodies absorb—and their precious, precious, <br>precious blood;</p><p>Which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again give me, many a year hence,<br>In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence;<br>In blowing airs from the fields, back again give me my darlings—give my immortal <br>heroes;</p><p>Exhale me them centuries hence—breathe me their breath—let not an atom be lost;<br>O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!<br>Exhale them perennial, sweet death, years, centuries hence.</p><p>Or again in this:</p><p>Look down, fair moon, and bathe this scene;<br>Pour softly down night's nimbus floods, on faces ghastly, swollen, purple;<br>On the dead, on their backs, with their arms toss'd wide,<br>Pour down your unstinted nimbus, sacred moon.</p><p>The following exquisite stanza illustrates the poet's power to give a human interest to inanimate objects, and his biblical largeness and freedom in the use of metaphors:</p><p>Bathed in war's perfume—delicate flag!<br>O to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers! flag like a beautiful woman!<br>O to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men! O the ships they arm with <br>joy!</p><p>O to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships!<br>O to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks!<br>Flag like the eyes of women.</p><p>We invite the reader's careful consideration of one more piece, in which the poet's subtle art and large range of sympathies are perhaps best seen—the poem commemorating the death of Lincoln, beginning, 'When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed.' This poem must not be dismissed with a single perusal—a caution, indeed, which may well be observed in reference to the whole book. For, let it be understood, we are dealing with one of the most tyrannical and exacting of bards—one who steadfastly refuses to be read in any but his own spirit. It is only after repeated readings and turning to him again and again, that the atmosphere he breathes is reached. 'You must Summer and Winter with people to know them,' says an old proverb, which is especially true of this poet. The piece referred to is like intricate and involved music, with subtle, far-reaching harmonies. By that curious indirect method which is always the method of nature, the poet makes no reference to the mere facts of Lincoln's death—neither describes it, or laments it, or dwells upon its unprovoked atrocity, or its political aspects, but quite beyond the possibilities of the art of the ordinary versifier, he seizes upon three beautiful facts of nature which he weaves into a wreath for the dead President's tomb. The central thought is of death, but around this he curiously twines, first the early blooming lilacs which the poet may have plucked the day the dark shadow came; next the song of the hermit thrush, the most sweet and solemn of all our songsters, heard at twilight in the dusky cedars; and with these the evening star, which, as many may remember, night after night in the early part of that eventful Spring, hung low in the west with unusual lustre and brightness. These are the premises whence he starts his solemn chant.</p><p>The poem may disappoint on the first perusal. The treatment of the subject is so unusual—so unlike the direct and prosy style to which our ears have been educated—that it seems to want method and purpose. It eludes one; it hovers and hovers and will not be seized by the mind, though the soul feels it. But it presently appears that this is precisely the end contemplated by the poet. He would give as far as possible the analogy of music, knowing that in that exalted condition of the sentiments at the presence of death in a manner so overwhelming, the mere facts or statistics of the matter are lost sight of, and that it is not a narrative of the great man's death, done into rhyme, however faultless, or an eulogy upon his character, however just and discriminating, that offers an opportunity for the display of the highest poetic art, or that would be the most fitting performance on an occasion so august and solemn. Hence the piece has little or none of the character of the usual productions on such occasions. It is dramatic, yet there is no procession of events or development of plot, but a constant interplay—a turning and re-turning of images and sentiments, so that the section in which is narrated how the great shadow fell upon the land occurs far along in the piece. It is a poem that may be slow in making admirers, yet it is well worth the careful study of every student of literature.</p><p>Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,<br>Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>With the pomp of the inloop’d flags, with the cities draped in black,<br>With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil’d women, standing,<br>With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,<br>With the countless torches lit—with the silent sea of faces, and the unbared heads,<br>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and solemn;<br>With all the mournful voices of the dirges, pour’d around the coffin,<br>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—Where amid these you journey,<br>With the tolling, tolling bells’ perpetual clang;<br>Here! coffin that slowly passes,<br>I give you my sprig of lilac.</p><p>(Nor for you, for one, alone;<br>Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring:<br>For fresh as the morning—thus would I carol a song for you, O sane and sacred death.</p><p>All over bouquets of roses,<br>O death! I cover you over with roses and early lilies;<br>But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,<br>Copious, I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes;<br>With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,<br>For you, and the coffins all of you, O death.)</p><br><p>O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?<br>And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?<br>And what shall my perfume be, for the grave of him I love?</p><p>Sea-winds, blown from east and west,<br>Blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on the prairies <br>meeting:<br>These, and with these, and the breath of my chant,<br>I perfume the grave of him I love.</p><p>O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?<br>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,<br>To adorn the burial-house of him I love?</p><p>Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,<br>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke lucid and bright,<br>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expand-<br>ing the air;</p><p>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the trees pro-<br>lific;</p><p>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with a wind-dapple here and <br>there;</p><p>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and shadows;<br>And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward returning.</p><p>The poem reaches, perhaps, its height in the matchless invocation to Death:</p><p>Come, lovely and soothing Death,<br>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br>In the day, in the night, to all, to each,<br>Sooner or later, delicate Death.</p><p>Prais’d be the fathomless universe,<br>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious;<br>And for love, sweet love—But praise! O praise and praise<br>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death,</p><p>Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,<br>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?<br>Then I chant it for thee—I glorify thee above all;<br>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.</p><p>Approach, strong Deliveress!When it is so—when thou hast taken them, I joyously sing the dead,Lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O Death.</p><p>From me to thee glad serenades,<br>Dances for thee I propose, saluting thee—dornments and feastings for thee;<br>And the sights of the open landscape, and the high-spread sky, are fitting,<br>And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.</p><p>The night, in silence, under many a star;<br>The ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice I know;<br>And the soul turning to thee, O vast and well-veil’d Death,<br>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.</p><p>The gravity and seriousness of this book and its primitive untaught ways are entirely new in modern literature. With all our profuse sentimentalism, there is no deep human solemnity—the solemnity of a strong, earnest affectionate, unconventional man—in our literature. There are pathos and tears and weeds of mourning; but we would indicate an attitude or habit of the soul which is not expressed by melancholy—which is no sudden burst, or fit, or spasm—which is not inconsistent with cheerfulness and good nature, but which is always coupled with these—a state or condition induced by large perceptions, faith, and deep human sympathies. It may be further characterized as impatient of trifles and dallyings, tires even of wit and smartness, dislikes garrulity and fiction and all play upon words, and is but one remove from silence itself. The plainness and simplicity of the biblical writers afford the best example.</p><p>Contemplation, without love or sympathy, of the foibles, follies, and fashions of men and women and of their weaknesses and oddities begets the punning, scoffing, caricaturing habit we deprecate; contemplation of the laws and movements of society, the shows and processes of nature and issues of life and death, begets the rugged faith and sweet solemnity we would describe in 'Drum Taps.'</p><p>The reader perceives that the quality of these poems is not in any word, or epithet, or metaphor, or verbal and labial felicity whatever; but in the several atmospheres they breathe and exhale. The poet does not aim to load his pages with sweets—he makes no bouquets, distils no perfumes—whatever flower-scents there are, are lost in a smell as of the earth, the shore, the woods. Fine writing, with him, goes for naught. He seeks neither to please nor startle, nor even convince any more than nature does; and beauty follows, if at all, never as the aim, always as the result. There are none of the generally sought for, and, when found, much applauded, delicate fancies or poetical themes—but a large and loving absorption of whatever the earth holds. And this leads us to our final remark upon this subject, in making which we mean discredit to none.</p><p>It seems to us that Walt Whitman possesses almost in excess, a quality in which every current poet is lacking. We mean the faculty of being in entire sympathy with nature, and the objects and shows of nature, and of rude, abysmal man; and appalling directness of utterance therefrom, without any intermediate agency or modification.</p><p>The influence of books and works of art upon an author may be seen in all respectable writers. If knowledge alone made literature, or culture genius, there would be no dearth of these things among the moderns. But we feel bound to say that there is something higher and deeper than the influence or perusal of any or all books, or all other productions of genius—a quality of information which the masters can never impart, and which all the libraries do not hold. This is the absorption by an author, previous to becoming so, of the spirit of nature, through the visible objects of the universe, and his affiliation with them subjectively and objectively. The calm, all-permitting, wordless spirit of nature yet so eloquent to him who hath ears to hear! The sunrise, the heaving sea, the woods and mountains, the storm and the whistling winds, the gentle Summer day, the Winter sights and sounds, the night and the high dome of stars—to have really perused these, especially from childhood onward, till what there is in them so impossible to define finds its full mate and echo in the mind—his only is the lore which breathes the breath of life into all the rest. Without it, literary productions may have the superb beauty of statues, but with it only can they have the beauty of life.</p><p>JOHN BURROUGHS.</p>",

	"body": "<p>1. WALT WHITMAN's Drum-Taps New York. 1865. 12mo. pp. 72.</p><p>2. Sequel to Drum-Taps. (Since the preceding came from the Press.) When Lilacs last in the Dooryard bloomed, and Other Pieces</p><p>IT is fortunate that 'Walt Whitman's Drum-Taps,' unlike his 'Leaves of Grass,' is in point of propriety unexceptionable, so that it can be judged on its intrinsic merits.</p><p>The pieces of which 'Drum-Taps' consists are in form, like those in 'Leaves of Grass,' neither blank verse nor rhythmical prose. A poet of genuine artistic power would suffer from the absence of those restraints which are to genius what its banks are to a river,—limitations that aid in the development of beauty and of force; and Mr. Whitman is so far from being an artist, that he boasts of his lack of culture, after the fashion of 'self-made' men. Yet it is precisely this deficiency which disguises his real excellence, and stands between him and the fame he predicts for himself. A writer whose works are to live must have taste to discriminate between what is worth saying in a given poem, and what is not worth saying, and must have courage to excise the latter. The business of cataloguing the works of creation should be left to the auctioneer.</p><p>Poets of vastly more genius and culture than Mr. Whitman possesses have committed the error of thinking all objects and fancies equally worthy of a poem. Wordsworth, for example, patched his shining robes with homespun; but Wordsworth had the manners and speech of a gentleman, while Whitman has the characteristics, good and bad, of a Bowery boy. His love of New York City has more in common with Gavroche's love for Paris than with that of Victor Hugo, and more in common with Tony Weller's love for London than with that of Dr. Johnson, Lamb, or even Dickens. His glorification of America smacks of the 'We can lick all creation' of Tammany Hall. But with the extravagance, coarseness, and general 'loudness' of Bowery boys, Mr. Whitman possesses in an unusual degree their better traits. He is not ashamed of the body he lives in, and he calls all things by plain names. His compositions, without being sentimental or pretty, show genuine sensibility to the beauty of nature and of man. His braggart patriotism evinced its genuineness during the war.</p><p>'Beauty, knowledge, fortune, inure not to me, yet there are two things inure to me.<br>I have nourished the wounded and soothed many a dying soldier;<br>And at intervals I have strung together a few songs,<br>Fit for war and the life of a camp.'</p><p>The fact that the 'songs' in Drum-Taps were written under such circumstances ought to have rebutted in the most fastidious minds whatever presumption may have been raised against the volume by previous publications.</p><p>But the claims of these productions to consideration rest upon a more solid basis than the author's personal services in the hospital. Mr. Whitman not only possesses an almost photographic accuracy of observation, a masculine directness of expression, and real tenderness of feeling, but he sometimes hits upon an original epithet which illuminates a page of prosaic details. He speaks of 'the sturdy artillery…soon, unlimbered to begin the red business'; 'the hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted, robust year' (1861); the 'hinged knees and steady hand' of the dresser of wounds; the 'elderly (sick) man, so gaunt and grim, with well-grayed hair and flesh all sunken about the eyes'; 'million-footed, superb-faced Manhattan'; 'the wind with girlish laughter'; the 'gentle, soft-born, measureless light'; 'the gorgeous, indolent, sinking sun, burning, expanding the air'; 'the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty'; 'the huge and thoughtful night.' And in at least three places he shows more sustained, if not higher power. The effect of the news from Sumter upon New York is thus described:—</p><p>'The Lady of this teeming and turbulent city,<br>Sleepless, amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,<br>With her million children around her—suddenly<br>At dead of night, at news from the South,<br>Incensed , struck with clenched hand the pavement.'</p><p>'Old Ireland' is personified as</p><p>'Crouching over a grave, an ancient, sorrowful mother,<br>Once a queen,now lean and tattered, seated on the ground,<br>Her old white hair drooping dishevelled round her shoulders;<br>At her feet fallen an unused royal harp.'<br><p>But Mr. Whitman's faculty is, perhaps, most fully shown in the poem entitled, 'When Lilacs Last in the Door-Yard Bloomed'; in which the contrast of the beauty and life of the opening spring with the scenes presented and the thoughts awakened by the funeral of Abraham Lincoln is drawn with unexpected power. The poem is, as a whole, remarkable, but we must content ourselves with a brief quotation.</p><p>'Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities;<br>Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes—passing the endless grass;<br>Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud in the dark-brown <br>fields uprising;<br>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave<br>Night and day journeys a coffin.<br>. . . . .<br>Through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,<br>With the pomp of the inloop’d flags, with the cities draped in black,<br>With the show of the States themselves, as of crape-veil’d women, standing,<br>With processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,<br>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,<br>With all the mournful voices of the dirges, poured around the coffin,<br>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs—Where amid these you journey,<br>With the tolling, tolling bells’ perpetual clang,<br>Here! coffin that slowly passes,<br>I give you my sprig of lilac.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p>Walt Whitman.*</p><p>BY ROBERT BUCHANAN.</p><p>THE grossest abuse on the part of the majority, and the wildest panegyric on the part of a minority, have for many years been heaped on the shoulders of the man who rests his claim for judgment on the book of miscellanies noted below. Luckily, the man is strong enough, sane enough, to take both abuse and panegyric with calmness. He believes hugely in himself, and in the part he is destined to take in American affairs. He is neither to be put down by prudes, nor tempted aside by the serenade of pipes and timbrels. A large, dispassionate, daring, and splendidly-proportioned animal, he remains unmoved, explanatory up to a certain point, but sphinx-like when he is questioned too closely on morality or religion. Yet when the enthusiastic and credulous, the half-formed, the inquiring, youth of a nation begin to be carried away by a man's teachings, it is time to inquire what these teachings are; for assuredly they are going to exercise extraordinary influence on life and opinion. Now, it is clear, on the best authority, that the writer in question is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates—his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. What the man is, and what the ministry implies, it will not take long to explain. Let it be admitted at the outset, however, that we are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capability for good.</p><p>Sprung from the masses, as he himself tells us, Walt Whitman has for many years lived a vagabond life, labouring, as the humour seized him, and invariably winning his bread by actual and persistent industry. He has been alternately a farmer, a carpenter, a printer. He has been a constant contributor of prose to the Republican journals. He appears, moreover, at intervals, to have wandered over the North American continent, to have worked his way from city to city, and to have consorted liberally with the draff of men on bold and equal conditions. Before the outbreak of the war, he was to be found dwelling in New York, on 'fish-shape Paumanok,' basking there in the rays of the almost tropical sun, or sallying forth into the streets to mingle with strange companions—from the lodging-house luminary and the omnibus driver, down to the scowling rowdy of the wharf bars. Having written his first book, 'Leaves of Grass,' he set it up with his own hands, in a printing-office in Brooklyn. Some of our readers may dimly remember how the work was briefly noticed by contemporary English reviews, in a way to leave the impression that the writer was a wild maniac, with morbid developments in the region of the os pelvis. On the outbreak of the great rebellion, he followed in the rear of the great armies, distinguishing himself by unremitting attention to the wounded in the Ambulance Department, until, on receiving a clerkship in the Department of the Interior, he removed to Washington. Here, to the great scandal of American virtue, he continued to vagabondize as before, but without neglecting his official duties. At the street corner, at the drinking-bar, in the slums, in the hospital wards, the tall figure of Walt Whitman was encountered daily by the citizens of the capital. He knew everybody, from the President down to the crossing-sweeper.</p> <p>'Well,' said Abraham Lincoln, watching him as he stalked by, 'he looks like a man.'</p><p>Latterly, his loafing propensities appear to have grown too strong for American tolerance, and he was ejected from his clerkship, on the pretext that he had written 'indecent verses,' and was a 'free lover.' His admirers, indignant to a man at this treatment, have accumulated protest upon protest, enumerating numberless instances of his personal goodness and self-denial, and laying powerful emphasis on certain deeds which, if truly chronicled, evince a width of sympathy and a private influence unparalleled, perhaps, in contemporary history. With all this personal business we have no concern. His admirers move for a new trial on the evidence of his written works, and to that evidence we must proceed.</p><p>In about ten thousand lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence, Walt Whitman professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man, and, more particularly, indicating the great elements which distinguish American freedom from the fabrics erected by European politicians. Starting from Paumanok, where he was born, he takes mankind in review, and sees everywhere but one wondrous life—the movement of the great masses, seeking incessantly under the sun for guarantees of personal liberty. He respects no particular creed, admits no specific morality prescribed by the civil law, but affirms in round terms the universal equality of men, subject to the action of particular revolutions, and guided en masse by the identity of particular leaders. The whole introduction is a reverie on the destiny of nations, with an undertone of forethought on the American future, which is to contain the surest and final triumph of the democratical man. A new race is to arise, dominating previous ones, and grander far, with new contests, new politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts. But how dominating? By the perfect recognition of individual equality, by the recognition of the personal responsibility and spiritual significance of each being, by the abrogation of distinctions such as set barriers in the way of perfect private action—action responsible only to the being of whom it is a consequence, and inevitably controlled, if diabolic, by the combined action of masses.</p><p>Briefly, Walt Whitman sees in the American future the grandest realization of centuries of idealism—equable distribution of property, luminous enlargement of the spiritual horizon, perfect exercise of all the functions; no apathy, no prudery, no shame, none of that worst absenteeism wherein the soul deserts its proper and ample physical sphere, and sallies out into the regions of the impossible and the unknown. Very finely, indeed, does the writer set forth the divine functions of the body—the dignity and the righteousness of a habitation existing only on the condition of personal exertion; and faintly, but truly, does he suggest how from that personal exertion issues spirituality, fashioning literatures, dreaming religions, and perfecting arts. 'I will make,' he exclaims, 'the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems; and I will make the poems of my body and of mortality: for I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.'</p><p>This, we hear the reader exclaim, is rank Materialism; and, using the word in its big sense, Materialism it doubtless is. We shall observe, further on, in what consists the peculiar value of the present manifestation. In the meantime, we must continue our survey of the work.</p><p>Having broadly premised, describing the great movements of masses, Walt Whitman proceeds, in a separate 'poem' or 'book,' to select a member of the great democracy, representing typically the privileges, the immunities, the conditions, and the functions of all the rest. He cannot, he believes, choose a better example than himself so he calls this poem 'Walt Whitman.' He is for the time being, and for poetical purposes, the cosmical Man, an entity, a representative of the great forces.† He describes the delight of his own physical being, the pleasure of the senses, the countless sensations through which he communicates with the material universe. All, he says, is sweet—smell, taste, thought, the play of his limbs, the fantasies of his mind; every attribute is welcome, and he is ashamed of none. He is not afraid of death; he is content to change, if it be the nature of things that he should change, but it is certain that he cannot perish. He pictures the pageant of life in the country and in cities; all is a fine panorama, wherein mountains and valleys, nations and religions, genre, pictures and gleams of sunlight, babes on the breast and dead men in shrouds, pyramids and brothels, deserts and populated streets, sweep wonderfully by him. To all those things he is bound:—wherever they force him, he is not wholly a free agent; but on one point he is very clear—that, so far as he is concerned, he is the most important thing of all. He has work to do; life is not merely a suck or a sell; nay, the whole business of ages has gone on with one object only—that he, the democrat, Walt Whitman, might have work to do. In these very strange passages, he proclaims the magnitude of the preparations for his private action:—</p><p>'Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?</p><p>What is a man, anyhow? What am I? What are you?</p><p>All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with your own,<br>Else it were time lost listening to me.</p><p>I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>That months are vacuums, and the ground but wallow and filth;<br>That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare <br>crape, and tears.</p><p>Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids—conformity goes to <br>the forth-removed;<br>I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out.</p><p>Why should I pray? Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?</p><p>Having pried through the strata, analysed to a hair, counsel'd with doctors, and<br> calculated close,<br>I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.</p><p>In all people I see myself—none more, and not one a barleycorn less;<br>And the good or bad I say of myself, I say of them.</p><p>And I know I am solid and sound;<br>To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow;<br>All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.</p><p>I know I am deathless;<br>I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter's compass;<br>I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.</p><p>I know I am august;<br>I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or be understood;<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologize;<br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)</p><p>I exist as I am—that is enough;<br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;<br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content.</p><p>One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;<br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million years,<br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p><p>My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution;<br>And I know the amplitude of time.</p><br><p>I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I am an encloser of things to be.</p><p>My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs;<br>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps;<br>All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.</p><p>Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me;<br>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing—I know I was even there;<br>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,<br>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.</p><p>Long I was hugg'd close—long and long.</p><p>Immense have been the preparations for me,<br>Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.</p><p>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen;<br>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings;<br>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.</p><p>Before I was born out of my mother, generations guided me;<br>My embryo has never been torpid—nothing could overlay it.</p><p>For it the nebula cohered to an orb,<br>The long slow strata piled to rest it on,<br>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,<br>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths, and deposited it with care</p><p>All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me;<br>Now on this spot I stand with my robust Soul.</p><p>It is impossible in an extract to convey an idea of the mystic and coarse, yet living, force which pervades the poem called 'Walt Whitman.' We have chosen an extract where the utterance is unusually clear and vivid. But more extraordinary, in their strong sympathy, are the portions describing the occupations of men. In a few vivid touches we have striking pictures; the writer shifts his identity like Proteus, but breathes the same deep undertone in every shape. He can transfer himself into any personality, however base. 'I am the man—I suffered—I was there.' He cares for no man's pride. He holds no man unclean.</p><p>And afterwards, in the poem called 'Children of Adam,' he proceeds to particularize the privileges of flesh, and to assert that in his own personal living body there is no uncleanness. He sees that the beasts are not ashamed; why, therefore, should he be ashamed? Then comes passage after passage of daring animalism; the functions of the body are unhesitatingly described, and the man asserts that the basest of them is glorious. All the stuff which offended American virtue is to be found here. It is very coarse, but, as we shall see, very important. It is never, however, inhuman; indeed, it is strongly masculine—unsicklied by Lesbian bestialities and Petronian abominations. It simply chronicles acts and functions which, however unfit for art, are natural, sane, and perfectly pure. We shall attempt to show further on that Walt Whitman is not an artist at all, not a poet, properly so called; and that this grossness, offensive in itself, is highly significant—an essential part of very imperfect work. The general question of literary immorality need not be introduced at all. No one is likely to read the book who is not intelligently chaste, or who is not familiar with numberless authors offensive to prudes—Lucretius, Virgil, Dante, Goethe, Byron, among poets; Tacitus, Rabelais, Montaigne, Cervantes, Swedenborg, among prose thinkers.</p><p>The remainder of 'Leaves of Grass' is occupied with poems of democracy, and general monotonous prophecies. There is nothing more which it would serve our present purpose to describe in detail, or to interpret. The typical man continues his cry, encouraging all men,—on the open road, in the light of day, in the region of dreams. All is right with the world, he thinks. For religion he advises, 'Reverence all things'; for morality, 'Be not ashamed'; for political wisdom among peoples, 'Resist much—obey little.' He has no word for art; it is not in her temple that he burns incense. His language, as even a short extract has showed, is strong, vehement, instantaneously chosen; always forcible, and sometimes even rhythmical, like the prose of Plato. Thoughts crowd so thick upon him, that he has no time to seek their artistic equivalent; he utters his thought in any way, and his expressions gain accidental beauty from the glamour of his sympathy. As he speaks, we more than once see a man's face at white heat, and a man's hand beating down emphasis at the end of periods. He is inspired, not angry; yet as even inspiration is not infallible, he sometimes talks rank nonsense.</p><p>The second part of the volume, 'Drum-Taps,' is a series of poetic soliloquies on the war. It is more American and somewhat less mystical than the 'Leaves of Grass'; but we have again the old cry of democracy. Here, in proportion to the absence of self-consciousness, and the presence of vivid emotion, we find absolute music, culminating once or twice in poetry. The monody on the death of Lincoln—'when lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed'—contains the three essentials of poetic art—perfect vision, supreme emotion, and true music. This, however, is unusual in Walt Whitman. Intellectual self-consciousness generally coerces emotion, insincerities and follies ensue, and instead of rising into poetry, the lines wail monotonously, and the sound drops into the circle of crabbed prose.</p><p>For there is this distinction between Walt Whitman and the poet—that Whitman is content to reiterate his truth over and over again in the same tones, with the same result; while the poet, having found a truth to utter, is coerced by his artistic sympathies into seeking fresh literary forms for its expression. 'Bawling out the rights of man,' wrote Horne Tooke, 'is not singing.' Artistic sympathies Walt Whitman has none; he is that curiously-crying bird—a prophet with no taste. He is careless about beautifying his truth: he is heedless of the new forms—personal, dramatic, lyrical—in which another man would clothe it, and in which his disciples will be certain to clothe it for him. He sees vividly, but he is not always so naturally moved as to sing exquisitely. He has the swagger of the prophet, not the sweetness of the musician. Hence all those crude metaphors and false notes which must shock artists, those needless bestialities which repel prudes, that general want of balance and that mental dizziness which astonish most Europeans.</p><p>But when this has been said, all blame has been said, if, after all, a man is to incur blame for not being quite another sort of being than nature made him. Walt Whitman has arisen on the States to point the way to new literatures. He is the plain pioneer, pickaxe on shoulder, working and 'roughing.' The daintier gentlemen will follow, and build where he is delving.</p><p>Whitman himself would be the first to denounce those loose young gentlemen who admire him vaguely because he is loud and massive, gross and colossal, not for the sake of the truth he is teaching, and the grandeur of the result that may ensue. There are some men who can admire nothing unless it is 'strong'; intellectual dram-drinkers, quite as far from the truth as sentimental tea-drinkers. Let it at once and unhesitatingly be admitted that Whitman's want of art, his grossness, his tall talk, his metaphorical word-piling, are faults—prodigious ones; and then let us turn reverently to contemplate these signs which denote his ministry, his command of rude forces, his nationality, his manly earnestness, and, last and greatest, his wondrous sympathy with men as men. In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. He emerges from the mass of unwelded materials—in shape much like the Earth-spirit in Faust. He is loud and coarse, like most prophets, 'sounding,' as he himself phrases it, 'his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.' He is the voice of which America stood most in need—a voice at which ladies scream and gigmen titter, but which clearly pertains to a man who means to be heard. He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied, but not perhaps to be beheld till the vast American democracy has subsided a little from its last and grandest struggle. Honour in his generation is of course his due, but he does not seem to solicit honour. He is too thoroughly alive to care about being tickled into activity, too excited already to be much moved by finding himself that most badgered of functionaries, the recognized Sir Oracle.</p><p>∗ Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass,' 'Drum-Taps,' etc New York, 1867.</p><p>†Let it be understood, here and elsewhere, that we shall attach our own significance to passages in themselves sufficiently mystical. We may misrepresent this writer; but, apart from the present constructions, he is to us unintelligible.</p>",
