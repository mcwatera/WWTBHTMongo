	"body": "<p><em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em>. Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti London: John Camden Hotten. 1868.</p><p>Some years ago, when a few copies of a volume called Leaves of Grass found their way into this country from America, the general verdict of those who had an opportunity of examining the book was that much of it was indescribably filthy, most of it mere incoherent rhapsody, none of it what could be termed poetry in any sense of the word, and that, unless at the hands of some enterprising Holywell Street publisher, it had no chance of the honour of an English reprint. In part this opinion is already proved to have been a mistaken one, for a Westend publisher has taken compassion on the stranger, and now presents it to the British public in a comely form. It may be as well to state at the outset, that the volume published by Mr. Hotten is not precisely a reprint of the original Leaves of Grass. It contains much new matter written since the appearance of that work, and does not contain any of the pieces marked by that peculiar freedom of speech which is generally associated in men's minds with the name of Walt Whitman. For the sake of all parties, the prurient as well as the prudish, lest the one should be unnecessarily alarmed or the other led into an unremunerative venture, it is only fair to say that there is nothing in the present edition to disqualify it for decent society, not to say qualify it for a place in the Bibliothèque bleue . It has cost Mr. Rossetti severe pangs so he informs us, to part with so much as, from considerations of prudence, he has been obliged to exclude. 'This peculiarly nervous age,' this 'mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century,' with its present absurd notions about decency, morality, and propriety, could not be expected to receive 'the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings,' in that æsthetic spirit in which they should be accepted; and, as he was unwilling to mutilate, 'the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems, and some extremely fine ones—notably one of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled, Walt Whitman.' In one respect we are willing to admit the loss sustained in this last instance. The 'poem' here referred to is the one which contains the key to Walt Whitman's philosophy and poetic theory. It is in it that he describes himself and his qualifications for the office of poet of the future, grounding his claim upon the fact of his being 'hankering, gross, mystical, nude, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, no more modest than immodest'; and proposing to produce poetry of corresponding qualities, a promise which we must say he most conscientiously fulfils. Its excellence may be open to question, but about its value to the reader who wishes to understand Walt Whitman there can be no doubt whatever.</p><p>The present edition is to be considered as an experiment. By excluding everything offensive, the editor hopes to induce people to reconsider the case of Walt Whitman, and reverse the verdict which has been already pronounced. This, we need scarcely observe, is rather more than they can be fairly asked to do, while the evidence which supports the gravest of charges brought against him is suppressed. But this is not all that Mr. Rossetti expects. The present selection is so to brace and fortify the British mind that in a short time, he trusts, it will be able to relish what now in its weakness it rejects. A complete edition of Walt Whitman, with all the dirt left in, he looks forward to as 'the right and crowning result' of his labours. This is but the school-boy's pudding, which, if we only finish it off, is to be succeeded by a full meal of the uncommonly strong meat he has in reserve for us. We must confess we should very much prefer to see Mr. Rossetti employing himself on some task more worthy of his abilities. He has on many occasions done good service as a critic to literature and art, but we cannot look upon his present enterprise as one in any way beneficial to either. He desires to have Walt Whitman recognized, not merely as a great poet, but as the founder of a new school of poetic literature which is to be greater and more powerful than any the world has yet seen. He is not, it is true, entirely alone in this attempt. There have been already certain indications of a Walt Whitman movement in one or two other quarters. More than a year ago there was a paper in the Fortnightly Review , which, however, was not so much a criticism of his poetry as of his person, the writer having had, as well as we recollect, the privilege of reviewing him as he bathed-an important advantage, certainly, in the case of a poet whose principal theme is his own body. Then Mr. Robert Buchanan took him up in the Broadway magazine, and, saying nearly all that has ever been said against Walt Whitman—that he is no poet and no artist, that he is gross, monotonous, loud, obscure, prone to coarse animalism and to talking rank nonsense—nevertheless arrived at pretty much the same conclusion as Mr. Rossetti, at least as to the powerful influence he is to exercise over the literature of the future. Something of this sort we might, indeed have expected. There are people whose reading of the Horatian saying about popular opinion is 'nunquam vulgus rectum videt,' and who always set themselves to find virtues in everything that is generally condemned. Besides, it would be idle to deny that Walt Whitman has many attractions for minds of a certain class. He is loud, swaggering, and self-assertive, and so gets credit for strength with those who worship nothing that is not strong. He is utterly lawless, and in consequence passes for being a great original genius. His produce is unlike anything else that has ever appeared in literature, and that is enough for those who are always on the look-out for novelty. He is rich in all those qualities of haziness, incoherence, and obscurity which seem to be the first that some readers nowadays look for in poetry. But, above all, he runs a muck with conventionalities and decencies of every sort, which naturally endears him to those silly people who take a childish delight in seeing the respectabilities of the world pulled by the nose, and what they consider its stupid prejudices shocked. We need scarcely say we do not suspect a man of Mr. Rossetti's taste and judgment of this kind of enthusiasm. If we were to hazard a theory, we should be inclined to attribute his advocacy of Walt Whitman's poetical claims to an impatience of the feebleness, emptiness, and sentimentality so abundant in modern poetry. The feeling is one with which we do not quarrel; we only object to the form in which it finds expression. A plague of tinkling cymbals is not to be met by a counter treatment of sounding brass.</p><p>An admirer of Walt Whitman has one immense advantage. There is no standard by which his idol can be measured, no known test which can be applied to prove his quality. There is, therefore, a wide field for that dogmatic assertion which is the favourite argument of the transcendental critic. You must not object that his poetry has no melody, music, or form. It is something above and beyond all requirements of that kind. You are not to raise the objection that in a great deal of what he writes there is no meaning at all, and in a great deal more the meaning, when got at, is utterly commonplace. Poetry like Walt Whitman's is not to be judged of by any one who is influenced by narrow considerations of meaning. You are not to take exception to his language, that it is a vile jargon of his own coining. A poet of this order naturally rises above the trammels of precedent in the matter of language. As to the absence of imagination, invention, fancy, art, and sundry other things more or less looked for in poetry, to complain of this in the present instance only shows that you are incapable of understanding the subject. This sort of argument always tells powerfully with the timid, with those people who are haunted by a nervous dread of being set down as dull and commonplace if they allow common sense to influence their judgment; and besides, it has the merit of being unanswerable, except by contradiction. When a man shows you something with all the outward and visible signs of a wheelbarrow, and tells you it is an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to know what to say to him; and it is just as hard to know what to say when you are offered something like the following and told it as poetry, and poetry of a very high order. As the admirers of Walt Whitman always protest against his being judged of fragmentarily, we take the shortest poem we can find, instead of giving the queerest extract:—</p><p><em>VISAGES.</em><br>Of the visages of things—And of piercing through to the accepted hells beneath.<br>Of ugliness—To me there is just as much in it as there is in beauty—And now the <br>ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.<br>Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, worse than <br>undetected persons—and are not in any respect worse than I am myself.<br>Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal—and any reputa-<br>ble person is also-and the President is also.</p><p>Now it may be that this is not balderdash, though we must confess to a strong suspicion that it is; but if it is poetry, all we can say is, we must find some other word for Shakspeare. Walt Whitman himself is much more candid on this point than his advocates. He certainly declares himself to be a poet, but at the same time he describes the offspring of his muse as a 'barbaric yawp.' We have no very definite idea as to the precise nature of a yawp, but, whatever it may be, it can scarcely be poetry.</p><p>We must do Mr. Rossetti the justice of admitting that he does not entirely rely on dogmatism in pleading the cause of his protégé. He does assign some few reasons why Walt Whitman should be accepted as 'the poet of the epoch.' In a paper which appeared in a weekly journal, he puts the claim on the rather curious ground of his being 'an initiator in the scheme and structure of his writings, and an individual of audacious personal ascendant.' But in the preface to the present volume he comes more plainly to the point. The reader, he says, is not to ask himself, or return any answer to the questions, whether or not Walt Whitman is like other poets, or whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of other poets, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in his work. 'Let the questions rather be—Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel, and make me feel?' To each of these questions we should be disposed to answer simply 'No,' were it not that an unqualified negative is scarcely polite. We can see no reason for considering Walt Whitman powerful. Strong he may be, but it is only in the sense in which an onion is strong. His noise, bluster, and arrogance are no more indications of true strength than the swagger of the professional athlete at a country fair, who struts up and down the stage in salmon-coloured tights, and passes for a Hercules with the crowd from the way in which he feels his muscles in public. That he is American in one sense we must admit. He is something which no other country could have produced. He is American as certain forms of rowdyism and vulgarity, excrescences on American institutions, are American. But that he is American in the sense of being representative of American taste, intellect, or cultivation, we should be very sorry indeed to believe. New he certainly is, but it is only in his audacity, and in the abnormal structure of his poetry; there is not a new thought in his writings from beginning to end. As to the other questions, the answer must depend very much on individual temperament. Whether or not he himself feels we cannot tell, but, so far from being rousing or making his reader feel, we should say that with ninety-nine out of a hundred average readers Walt Whitman, taken in any quantity, would be found to be about as soporific a poet as ever produced a yawn. But even if all these questions could be answered in the affirmative—even if we were to concede that Walt Whitman is powerful and new and American and rousing, and throw into the bargain what his friends invariably lay great stress upon, his magnificent physique and his irreproachable character in private life—still all this, we submit, does not make him out to be a poet. To call a man a poet merely because he holds forth in rhapsodical style, about one man being as good as another, everything being all right, every one having a right 'to do as he dam pleases'—if we may venture to quote the concise language of Transatlantic liberty—and other dogmas of the same sort, is to confuse the functions of the poet and the stump orator; and generally, when Walt Whitman has any meaning at all, it amounts to no more than this. Very often he has no meaning whatever. In his fury he breaks out into a mere perspiration of words, and strings substantives together for pages on a stretch, the result being a something which is as much like poetry as an auctioneer's catalogue. To be sure there is scattered through his pages a vast amount of that vagueness which to some tastes has the true poetic charm. No doubt there are people who consider this sort of thing very fine:—</p><p><em>OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</em><br>The skies of day and night—colours, densities, forms—May-be these are (as doubt-<br>less they are) only apparitions, and the real something has yet to be known;<br>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as from <br>my present point of view—And might prove (as of course they would) naught <br>of what they appear, or naught anyhow, from entirely changed points of view.</p><p>But if it is very fine, then so is Miss Codger's outburst on being introduced to Elijah Pogram:—</p><p>But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle, to which we give those titles, is a topic, spirit-searching, light-abandoned, much too vast to enter on.</p><p>But of course the special charm of Walt Whitman is that he is so—what his admirers call—unconventional; that is, that he says things which other people do not say, and in language which other people do not generally use. His unconventionality, however, is of a very cheap sort. It is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them. It is true that for the present we are spared the bolder strokes of his genius in this respect, but, as has been already mentioned, it is only for the present; and besides, Walt Whitman's grossness is not accidental, but constitutional. It arises partly from an insensibility to the difference between that which is naturally offensive and that which is not, partly from his peculiar theory of poetry. As it is a fundamental principle of his to recognize no law of any kind, and to submit to no restrictions of artistic propriety, it follows that with him all subjects are equally fit for poetic treatment. As Mr. Rossetti puts it, 'he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech,' and it is just this ignorance of his which, independently of other reasons, makes any attempt to set him up as a poetic model mischievous to the interests of literary art. It is not a question of squeamishness or hyper-sensitiveness. There is no prudery in objecting to nastiness, nor is there any originality, honesty, manliness, or courage in obtruding what even instinct teaches us to avoid. We cannot say, however, that we anticipate any serious injury to English or American literature from the influence or popularity of Walt Whitman's poetry, so long at least as people are courageous enough to use their common sense, and do not allow themselves to be led away by transcendental 'high-falutin' into pretending an admiration which they do not feel.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.*</strong></p><p>THIS edition of Walt Whitman's poems has been specially prepared for the British public, is weeded of those pieces the occasional phraseology of which was found, in former instances, to shock many people, and contains specimens of every thing that is characteristic in the American poet's writings. Of pruned editions we have, generally speaking, an abhorrence; but in this case several chance expressions which Walt Whitman permitted himself were so very rude that his poems, as a whole, were deprived of that fair judgment which by rights belongs to every artistic work. Now we are far from considering Walt Whitman the merely blatant egotist which many English critics would have him to be; and we are glad that an opportunity presents itself to the ordinary English reader of estimating for himself the value of a writer who is almost new to us. Nor should we be surprised if the publication of this volume procure for its author a complete reversal of that vague opinion of him—founded almost entirely on hearsay—which has hitherto been current in this country. Walt Whitman is not an inflated Tupper. He is nebulous, mystical, sometimes incoherent, often laboriously 'distinct' without being 'clear'—according to Leibnitz's fine definition—but at no time does he fail to impress his reader with the sense that here is a man of power, a man capable of producing a definite impression on the mind. This is a result which never accrues from commonplace. Walt Whitman is, indeed, the Turner of poets. Sometimes you find a mere blurred mass of colour; then a piece of apparent commonplace; and then a picture which overawes the beholder. You may come to these studies with any mood of mind, and find it gratified. They will afford material for jokes; they will offer proof of the author's entire ignorance of or contempt for system and precedent; they will justify the wildest praise and the bitterest abuse. These are possibilities one does not find in commonplace; whatever the work is, it cannot be that. We have more than once seen the rather curious objection preferred against Walt Whitman, that the impression he produced on his admirers is simply owing to his talking largely and being incomprehensible. That, however, is a form of literature which so many modern writers have made us familiar, that every reader can at once deny the fact of any impression being produced by such easy authorship beyond that of insufferable weariness. The ordinary graces of poetry are not to be found in these poems. They are, as we have said, without system or precedent; the utterances of a man with an amazing belief, not in himself as an individual, but in himself as a spokesman of a new country and a new time.</p><p>'And I too of the Manahatta, singing thereof <br>—and no less in myself than the whole<br> of the Manahatta in itself.'</p><p>Neither the dreams of Novalis nor the later speculations of Faraday are to be compared with that insistence of the mystic transmutation of spirit which this realistic and democratic poet sings. He does not worship the body, and passions, and infirmities of Walt Whitman; he worships these as all that he knows of humanity; and this is strikingly exemplified in a poem which has, unfortunately, but necessarily been omitted from the present edition. He seems to lose in his own mind all sense of the difference between the individual and the mass:—</p><p>'All architecture is what you do to it when <br>you look upon it;<br>Did you think it was in the white or grey <br>stone? or the lines of the arches and <br>cornices?<br>All music is what awakes from you <em>when you <br>are reminded by the instruments.'</em></p><p>Anthropomorphism of a subtle and indefinite kind seems to be his principle theme; an anthropomorphism, however, differing widely from that of the sensationalists. According to him, 'objects gross and the unseen Soul are one;' while as to spiritual creations:—</p><p>'We consider bibles and religions divine—I <br>do not say they are not divine;<br>I say they have all grown out of you, and <br>may grow out of you still;<br>It is not they who give the life—it is you <br>who give the life;<br>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or <br>trees from the earth, than they are shed <br>out of you.'</p><p>As a specimen of what may be called his 'prophetic manner,' take the following striking passage, full of a shadowy, but real and impressive force:—</p><p>'What whispers are these, O lands, running <br>ahead of you, passing under the seas?<br>Are all nations communing? Is there go-<br>ing to be but one heart to the globe?<br>Is humanity forming en masse? —for lo! <br>tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;<br>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, per-<br>haps a general divine war;<br>No one knows what will happen next—such <br>portents fill the days and nights.<br>Years prophetical! the space ahead, as I <br>walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full <br>of phantoms;<br>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their <br>shapes around me;<br>This incredible rush and heat—this strange <br>ecstatic fever of dreams, O years!<br>Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate <br>through me! (I know not whether I <br>sleep or wake!)<br>The performed America and Europe grow <br>dim, retiring in shadow behind me;<br>The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, <br>advance, advance upon me.'</p><p>Such is the cumbrous and ungainly 'method' of Walt Whitman's utterance; and that again is not unfrequently rendered more forbidding by an unnecessary diffuseness and what seems to us to be an intentional vagueness. That the writer of these poems—if poems they are to be called—is worthy of greater attention than has yet been paid him in England, we endeavored to show in a former article. For him, as for any other writer, we would bespeak a patient hearing. The material which he offers us is so novel and so bold, that we are ready to distrust any immediate critical estimate, and would fain see Walt Whitman pass into the crucible of popular reading. Mr. Rossetti, we think, has done his editorial work—in this case rendered peculiarly difficult—well; and we recommend the reader to pay careful attention to Mr. Rossetti's appreciate[ve] and yet impartial judgment of Whitman in the preface to the book. We should have preferred to the engraved portrait of Walt Whitman in the present volume a copy of the striking and picturesque photo of him lately taken in New York; but even the former will give the English reader some slight indication of the poet's features and expression. In other respects the edition is nicely got up; and we have no hesitation in commending it as an excellent index to the writings of a man who cannot be overlooked.</p><p>———</p><p>∗ Poems by Walt Whitman.

	"title": "Walt Whitman.—Second Notice",
	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.—SECOND NOTICE.*</p><p>———</p></strong><p>Somewhat more than a year ago (vide Sunday Times, March 3rd, 1867) we called the attention of our readers to the works of an American poet—Walt Whitman—at that moment all but unknown in England. While admitting all that was wild, disorderly, and extravagant in these writings, we did justice to the many high qualities they possessed, spoke of them as the most thoroughly national and characteristic poetry to which America had yet given birth, and anticipated for them, when the first feelings of dislike, which the violation of all received models had occasioned were repressed, a large measure of regard among the more cultivated classes of English readers. At the time we wrote, the volume containing Whitman's poems was one of the rarest in England. A few scattered copies could be found, belonging principally to those who had received the work in their capacity of reviewers. We spoke warmly of the desirability of placing it within the reach of a certain tolerably extensive class of readers, and discussed the feasibility of an English reprint. Sooner than we anticipated has such reprint come. It has taken, moreover, the form we expected a first edition of Whitman to bear;—a form not in itself attractive to scholars and students, but such as in the present case was alone to be expected, and such as the exceeding taste of the editor has rendered as little offensive as possible to the haters of expurgated editions. Many motives induce us to recur for a brief while to the works of Whitman, to do which the appearance of the first English edition affords a favourable opportunity. Enough has not yet been said about the man, and the edition itself is a novelty in English literature, deserving on its own account a few words of comment. Not, however, in the few phrases that follow, nor in many more, for which we have not space, should we hope to do justice to that remarkable kosmos, Walt Whitman. He is not a man to be easily dismissed. A few glibly-spoken phrases will not describe him or his work. His faults and excellences are of the kind least commonly encountered, and have phases enough to render just and satisfactory criticism a task of more than usual difficulty. Walt Whitman is undoubtedly a great man. His position as a poet is not likely to be conceded without much dispute. Conservatives in poetry will shrink from utterances which appear to defy all known canons, and possess scarcely one of the gifts hitherto judged indispensable to verse. Unreflective readers will see nothing but a harsh and over-daring Tupper. Those even, whose sympathies are broad, and who shrink from subjecting all poetry to the tape, may pause ere they bestow the title of verse on these strong and often inharmonious outpourings. But no thinking reader will dispute that he is in the presence of a man and a thinker. Whitman is entitled to rank with those men whose works are the scholar's especial delight. His mind is of the same order with that of Rabelais or Montaigne. Rightly to understand him, however, it is necessary to transport oneself in idea from the over-crowded and, in one sense, over-civilised world of Europe, to the great continent whose first seer he is. American life and institutions have impregnated Whitman's soul. American air has saturated his lungs. He knows nothing of old-world notions and conventions; laughs at them when he hears of them, or passes them by as things unworthy of a thought. He is an American, Manhattanese, a democrat. The world he lives in is untroubled with questions of kingcraft or priestcraft. Human nature, in the manifold developments which in its fight in city or backwood it assumes, he knows and loves. Comradeship is his motto. Men who work and love like he are his brothers. The question of success never enters into his calculations. He sings forgotten or unknown heroes as soon as those whose names are foremost in the scroll of fame. The imperfections of the human nature he contemplates are as well worthy of study as its perfections. Nothing about manhood is vile or unclean. His contempt for the assumptions of philosophy is not greater nor less than his disregard of the dogmatism of authority. He is the most pantheistic of pantheists. The God he worships reveals himself in all places, even where Egyptian or Phoenician would not have sought him. The divine in the human he understands and worships. Nothing with Whitman is unfit for the uses of poetry. Mr. Buchanan is not more ready to descend for the subject of his poetry to street or slum. Wordsworth is not more enraptured of solitude, or in closer communion with nature. His principal theme is, however, manhood; first, as he sees it in the individual that is himself, next as he sees it in the world at large, the American world that is. 'Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse: I say the form complete is worthier far. The female equally with the male, I sing.' His book is, as Mr. Rossetti admirably observes, the poem of personality and democracy. It is strong, passionate, rhapsodical even, and yet pervaded with matter-of-fact plainness of speech. It is extravagant at times both in reality and ideality. One thing, at least, it never is—unhealthy or morbid. The edition of Whitman's poems which Mr. Rossetti has published does not pretend to completeness. It is but a book of extracts. In its class, however, it is a model. Never before has the public had a volume of extracts in which it might depend with greater confidence upon the taste of him who chose. Our own dislike to selections is not greater than that which Mr. Rossetti proclaims. If, however, there are books of which one should know much while one cannot afford him to know all, we should like always to have Mr. Rossetti to taste and select for us. Mr. Rossetti announces his volume as intended rather to herald the entire work than to render it unnecessary. He has felt it expedient to give the public some knowledge of the first truly national poet America has produced, and has determined not to frighten away the general reader by printing the poems in which the writer flies in the face of prejudices entertained by a large portion of Englishmen. But Mr. Rossetti is no Bowdler. He has given us many poems entire. Others he has entirely omitted. This we at once admit is the only principle upon which work of this kind can be done, and yet find favour with thoughtful readers. Into the question of the value of English prejudice Mr. Rossetti does not enter. His few remarks are explanatory of his motives, neither deprecatory nor justificatory. The greatest works of all times, from the earliest literature of Greek and Hebrew, to the latest of France and England, are offensive to English prudery. He has given to the English world those writings of a great and unknown writer, which it may read without being shocked. If after reading these the public wants more, and cares to risk the chance of being shocked, it can obtain them. That is its own affair. Only in the preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass, which Mr. Rossetti has most judiciously included in his volume, are one or two passages left out, and these he had the author's permission to omit. For it is a fact, creditable alike to editor and publisher, that this work is published with the express sanction of the author, who will receive a royalty on every copy sold, and who has accorded liberty for the sale of the volume in America, wherein at present the earlier editions of Whitman are scarce and expensive. In Mr. Rossetti's preface—a model of grave thoughtful criticism, and free and elegant English—we have a few particulars of Whitman's biography; a description of his personal appearance, and an account of the reception which attended the first publication of his works in America. Some account is also given of his heroic conduct during the late war. The remainder is composed of criticisms upon Whitman's works, and an explanation of the theory of his workmanship. A portrait of the author, very admirably engraven, accompanies the volume, which is unusually elegant and attractive in appearance. In our previous account of Whitman, to which the present notice is intended as an appendix, we quoted as liberally from the published works as our space would permit. We are now, accordingly, exonerated from the necessity of supporting by extracts the opinions we have pronounced. We regret that we cannot quote one passage from the prose preface of which we have spoken. The whole of the preface is wonderfully powerful, sonorous, and trumpet-like, and is in itself sufficient to render, a desirable possession the volume in which it appears. As an exposition of Whitman's views of art it is profoundly interesting. We trust that now that Whitman's works are easily accessible, few Englishmen will care to leave them unread. For ourselves, we confess to sharing the opinion eloquently expressed by his English editor, 'His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken—that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere the uttermost orators of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>∗ <em>Poems of Walt Whitman</em>.

	"body": "<p><strong>Walt Whitman's Poems.</strong></p><p><em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em>. Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti One Vol., pp. 406. J.C. Hotten.</p><p>Opening this book has been to us a revelation. Reading it has yielded us exquisite pleasure. The remembrance of it sweetens life. Echoes from it haunt us in the thick of our occupations, 'under the shade of melancholy boughs,' in the throng of the streets, at our meals, in the midst of our conversations, anywhere, everywhere, under the likeliest and the unlikeliest circumstances. Before the volume now under notice came into our hands, the name of Walt Whitman was certainly known to us, but that was all. Now that we have read these selections—observe, these selections—from his 'Chants Democratic,' from his Drum Taps, from his Leaves of Grass, from his 'Songs of Parting,' we have learnt to love that name of his, it has become to us a synonym of pleasure, suggestive of thoughts, emotions, aspirations, expressed as in a new language, and, once so expressed, never afterwards to be altogether forgotten. To William Michael Rossetti, as the selecter of these poems, we are not simply, in old-fashioned phrase, beholden, we are not merely in courtlier terms his most obedient, we are his very gratefully, and that, moreover, in heartfelt truthfulness. Already in the columns of the clever but now dead and gone Chronicle, under date 6th July, 1867, the editor of this henceforth to us cherished volume of Walt Whitman's Poems had sounded the trumpet of admiration in praise of that particular poet of America. Here, however, he has made good, in every sense, his high, and, as it might have seemed to some, extravagant commendations. Of the justice of the estimate thus enunciated, these poems yield absolute demonstration. Apart from the selection now given to us by Mr Rossetti, we are desirous that it should be understood at once, however, by our readers, that we know nothing whatever of the writings of Walt Whitman. This we would especially premise. And for a sufficient reason. According to a very general rumour even over here in England, according to the showing of even so enthusiastic an appreciator of his genius as Mr Rossetti has (happily for us all) shown himself to be—Walt Whitman has written things that his own most ardent admirers would willingly let die. Yet, of all this, the volume now in our hand, here submitted to our consideration, bears not a particle of evidence. The leering satyrs have been scared away from among the beautiful umbrage. The dregs lurk no longer in the limpid draught placed at our lips. We can quaff without a qualm. There is no canker in the rose-wreath as it is thus brought within our reach—it is all fragrance and dripping with dew. Not a taint is here, in bloom, or foliage, or fruit. The very atmosphere investing these poems is all purity, like the breath of morning. And yet—though we never should have conjectured as much from these poems themselves—the Collective Writings of Walt Whitman must indubitably be tainted, flawed, polluted—and that, too, with a taint, a flaw, a pollution in no conceivable way to be extenuated. Mr Rossetti himself sets forth in regard to the incriminated poems (all of which he has carefully omitted in the process of making his selection) not one word, not one hint of extenuation. He says, indeed, that he considers 'that most of them would be much better away.' And, whatever else can be said of the editor of the present volume as a critic of poetic literature, it certainly cannot be said of him that he is a purist. 'Indecencies, improprieties, deforming erudities' there are, he tells us, scattered, it may even be abundantly scattered, here and there, over the Writings of Walt Whitman. Such they are acknowledged to be, in so many words, even by the critic thanks to whose judicious hands those damning blemishes have been discarded. Of their existence at all, we only know, now, by their own evil reputation. They themselves are not here. Nevertheless this selection is in no respect what we should call, in the ordinary acceptation of the words, an Expurgated Edition. There is here no emasculation. The poems that are given are given in their entirety. Mere parts have been nowhere selected. Abbreviations, elisions, excisions, the Editor has shrunk from as from impertinences. He has done his task well and wisely. And yet, task it can hardly be called—true labour of love as it has been (and no wonder) throughout. Although containing within it 'a little less,' we are told 'that [sic] half the entire bulk of Whitman's poetry,' this one volume affords a comprehensive view of the writer's genius in its integrity. It is no broken gem that is here placed in our hands for examination, but—'one entire and perfect chrysolite.' Before commenting upon Walt Whitman's poetical productions, however, so far as those are here brought within our survey, a word or two as to the man himself. Abraham Lincoln's exclamation on seeing him was—'Well, he looks like a man!' Nor can that exclamation be wondered at when one comes to sum up his characteristics. Lofty in stature, admirably well proportioned, of vigorous strength, of abounding health—forty-nine years of age on the last day of next month—his eyes of a light blue, his complexion florid, his beard fleecy and flowing, but already quite grey—cheerful and masculine in appearance—having a predilection for the society of common people—intensely fond of fine music, and with a great natural taste for works of art—absolutely indifferent 'as to either praise or blame of what he writes'—such, in brief, is Walt Whitman. Born on the 31st of May, 1819, at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, in the state of New York, somewhere about thirty miles from the great American capital and outport—he is but now in the prime or meridian of his manhood, though already old-looking in spite of his health, of his wholesome out-door life, his temperate habits, and his vigorous constitution. A schoolboy up to thirteen, afterwards a compositor, then a country teacher, then a press writer, then a newspaper editor, then a master printer, then (like his father) a carpenter and builder, then, throughout the Great Civil War, to the Northern Army, what Miss Nightingale was to the British Army at Scutari throughout the War in the Crimea. And, yet all along, and at last wholly and solely, what he is now for the rest of his days—a Poet. Before considering him as such, it is but justice to remark of him in his capacity as a practical philanthropist when attending the poor soldiers all through that tremendous struggle between North and South, between the Federals and the Confederates in America, that 'It is said that by the end of the war he had personally ministered to upwards of 100,000 sick and wounded.' Honour, therefore, to the brave, true heart, if only in remembrance of that one recorded fact in his history—a fact evidencing that Walt Whitman not only 'looks' but acts 'like a man.' Turning our glance, however, from the man himself to his productions, to those Poems of his which have been here selected for us from his 'Songs of Parting,' his Leaves of Grass, his Drum Taps, and so on—one peculiarity is at once especially noticeable in regard to them, and that is their startling, intense, and absolute originality. In their manner, they are unlike any other poems that have ever previously made their appearance. As a rule, they are rhymeless. But, always, always they are rhythmical, and yet rhythmical after a manner peculiarly and exceptionally their own. The lines are of any length—sometimes abbreviated to a little more than a monosyllable—occasionally running out to the extent of half-a-dozen alexandrines. Now standing, as one might say, on one foot, and that a-tip-toe—now running along upon as many feet as those of a centipede. But—with all this whimsicality and abandon of manner, with all this wild defiance of the hitherto dominant laws of poetical, and, for that matter even at times of rhetorical, construction—O the charm, the grace, the tenderness, the pathos, the abounding and captivating beauties scattered broadcast, with a lavish hand, with an affluent fancy, with the royal prodigality of genius, over these pages of true poetry! Nor can the daring originality thus manifested by Walt Whitman in the mere manner of his composition be regarded as so wholly unexampled. As has been admirably well asked—</p><p>'Was genius awed by Aristotle's rules<br>When Shakspeare burst the cobwebs of the schools?'</p><p>Flinging to the winds of heaven all the precedents of literature, this new poet of the New World, a poet intensely sui generis, one racy of the soil from which he has sprung, carves out his own way with a pen as trenchant as an axe, and goes upon that way of his rejoicing. About the only one rhymed passage in the whole of this otherwise quite rhymeless volume of poetry, is the opening of the song in celebration of the broad-axe in the 'Chants Democratic.' And, having but just now—in total forgetfulness at the moment, alike of that especial passage and of that particular song—likened Walt Whitman's pen, in the trenchant sweep of it, to an axe, such as it might be seen gleaming and crashing when wielded in the grip of a backwoodsman of thews and sinews like his own—upon our sudden remembrance immediately afterwards of his own words, the simile appears more than ever most appropriate. For, thus it is that Walt Whitman, in his 'Song of the Broad Axe,' apostrophises that—</p><p>'Weapon, shapely, naked, wan;<br>Head from the mother's bowels drawn!<br>Wooded flesh and metal bone; limb only one,<br> and lip only one!<br>Grey-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve<br> produced from a light seed sown!<br>Resting the grass amid and upon,<br>To be leaned, and to lean on.'</p><p>A pen no less potent, keen, piercing, than such a broad axe, 'to be leaned and to lean on,' resting the grass [Leaves of Grass] amid and upon'—is, most assuredly, for us the pen of Walt Whitman. Otherwise than in one fragmentary instance like the foregoing, the book is, as we have said, altogether rhymeless. Wonderfully rhythmical throughout, though in lines of the most oddly varying lengths, the poems of Walt Whitman—when the reader has once passed the Rubicon—exercise over that initiated reader's mind a potent and irresistible fascination. The Rubicon must be passed, however, as a preliminary, as the first and all-essential preliminary of initiation. Meaning by that, simply, that any one coming to the examination of Walt Whitman's poems with a view to their complete appreciation, must begin by, we won't say taking this and that for granted, we won't even say by making such and such allowances, for, so expressing ourselves, we might seem to be slighting the high inherent claims to respect of a great original writer, such as Walt Whitman: instead of that we will say then simply—that the all-essential preliminary we are alluding to is one purely of concession. Concede to Whitman the fashion of his verse—concede to him his terse but never bald realism—concede to him his exotic verbiage, his coinage of words occasionally, with a daring disregard alike of the laws of syntax and of philology—and the spell of the magician is felt at once and for ever! We are within the circle of his poetic incantations! He 'hath his will' thenceforth—as he lists—at his own pleasure over our hearts, our emotions, our imaginations. As exemplars, to begin with, of his magical power in mere word-painting—take almost haphazard a single line or verse picked out here and there from the midst of his descriptions:—</p><p>'Evening—me in my room—the setting sun,<br>The setting summer sun shining in my open windows, <br>showing the swarm of flies, suspended, balancing <br>in the air in the centre of the room, darting athwart, <br>up and down, casting swift shadows in specks on <br>the opposite wall, where the shine is.'</p><p>'The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after <br>the storm is lulled.'</p><p>'Me observing the spiral flight of two little yellow <br>butterflies shuffling between each other, ascending <br>high in the air.</p><p>'And the fish suspending themselves below there—and <br>the beautiful curious liquid.'</p><p>'In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, <br>with a wind-dapple here and there.'</p><p>These word paintings of Whitman's sometimes pass by their very vividness into whimsicalities, yet are, for all that, wondrous word-paintings nevertheless: as where he speaks of—</p><p>' . . .dabs of music;<br>Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of <br>the great organ.'</p><p>His word-painting power goes with him everywhere. Into the ship-building yard, for example, where we see with him, as if we, too, were there—</p><p>'The butter-coloured chips flying off in great flakes, <br>and slivers.</p><p>It goes with him, and we with it and with him through even the swinging of a door—</p><p>'The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed <br>and in haste.</p><p>Sometimes the secret of it lies even in a word—</p><p>'The dim-lit church and the shuddering organ .'</p><p>Or, again, as where conjuring up shapes before him in his reverie, he speaks, among others, of—</p><p>'The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by<br> sneaking footsteps.</p><p>Or, yet more even, where brooding over many exquisite imaginings, he says most oddly and whimsically—</p><p>'They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.'</p><p>Or, again in the same way, when, by one subtle word, we note the last agonised kiss of bereaved affection, when—</p><p>'The <em>twitching</em> lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying.'</p><p>The merest specks and atoms of beauty, however, are these little word-pictures noticeable in casual lines and phrases in Walt Whitman's poetry. Immeasurably more noteworthy are the large humanity and the wide philosophy evidenced and inculcated by his utterances. His cry is that of Happiness and of Adoration—</p><p>'For I do not see one imperfection in the universe.'</p><p>Another while he declares—</p><p>'That all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, <br>each as profound as any.'</p><p>And another while he ejaculates:—</p><p>'The sun and stars that float in the open air;<br>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it—surely the drift <br>of them is something grand!'</p><p>Adding—</p><p>'I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and <br>that it is happiness.'</p><p>Again, he is full of wonderment at the abounding wonders around him, among others at—</p><p>'The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and <br>the wonders that fill each minute of time forever.'</p><p>The wonder of wonders to him, however—the glory and consolation of his life—(the enunciation of which, of the joy and solace of which to fellow mortals, is among the most dearly-cherished aspirations of his ambition)—the one great end worth living for, being, according to Walt Whitman—Death. Thus he exclaims—</p><p>'And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it<br> may be turned to beautiful results—and I will show <br>that nothing can happen more beautiful than death.</p><p>It is thus that he speaks in his 'Song at Sunset' of—'the superb vistas of Death.' It is thus that in his poem addressed 'To one Shortly to Die,' he closes it not in pity but in felicitation—</p><p>'I do not commiserate—I congratulate you.'</p><p>It is thus he sings exultantly—</p><p>'I shall go with the rest.<br>We cannot be stopped at a given point—that is no satis-<br>faction,<br>To show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space <br>of time—that is no satisfaction;<br>We must have the indestructible breed of the best, regard-<br>less of time.<br>If otherwise, all these things come but to ashes of dung<br>If maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are <br>betrayed!<br>Then indeed suspicion of death.<br>Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect death I should <br>die now:<br>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well suited to-<br>ward annihilation?'</p><p>Consonant with his rapturous exultation in the thought of Death, consonant with his homage for the perfection of the universe, are his absolute confidence in the reality of the future, and his profound sense that all that is holiest has never yet in any way been adequately realised or appreciated:—</p><p>'I say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are<br> for religion's sake.<br>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough;<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, <br>and how certain the future is.'</p><p>Hence he sings, hence he is a Poet, hence he undertakes in these poems of his to write the 'evangel-poem of comrades and love.' Akin to his overflowing delight in the thought of the Now and the Hereafter, are the largeness and the depth, the exquisite self-abnegation and the all-embracing comprehensiveness of his humanity. To the very dregs and scum and squalor of the evil streets of a bad city he cries out—by a subtle violation of grammar, as it seems to us, i.e., in the verb we have italicised in the subjoined quotation, appealing to them as though he spoke with them from their own level—</p><p>'Because you are greasy and pimpled, or that you was <br>drunk, or a thief,<br>Or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now,<br>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, <br>and never saw your name in print,<br>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?'</p><p>At the City Dead House in his 'Leaves of Grass,' we see him standing—gazing—yearning, in tenderest pity and commiseration over—what? over 'an outcast form,' indeed, over the body of a poor dead prostitute—</p><p>'The divine woman, her body—I see her body—I look on <br>it alone,<br>That house, once full of passion and beauty—all else I <br>notice not;<br>No stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor <br>odours morbific impress me;<br>But the house alone—that wondrous house—that delicate <br>fair house—that ruin!<br>That immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings <br>ever built,<br>Or white domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure sur-<br>mounted—or all the old high-spired cathedrals,<br>That little house alone more than them all—poor desperate <br>house!<br>Fair, fearful work! tenement of a Soul! itself a Soul!<br>Unclaimed, avoided house! take one breath from my <br>tremulous lips;<br>Take one tear, dropped aside as I go, for thought of you,<br>Dead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! <br>crushed!<br>House of life—ere while talking and laughing—but, oh, <br>poor house! dead even then;<br>Months, years, an echoing, garnished house—but dead <br>dead, dead.'</p><p>So wide, so profound, so insatiable are the yearnings of this great heart for sympathy, that on turning to his poem on 'Envy' what do we find to be the cause of his Envy? Not a perusal of the records of heroism, not the thought of Mighty Generals or Men in Power, but—when he reads of the brotherhood of lovers—</p><p>'How through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, <br>long and long,<br>Through youth, and through middle and through old age, <br>how unfaltering, how affectionate, and faithful they <br>were,<br>Then I am pensive—I hastily put down the book, and <br>walk away, filled with the bitterest envy.'</p><p>In illustration of the same thought, or rather of the same tender, yearning for sympathy, read his commemoration of 'Parting Friends,'—</p><p>'Two simple men I saw to-day on the pier, in the midst <br>of the crowd parting the parting of dear friends;<br>The one to remain hung on the other's neck and pas-<br>sionately kissed him,<br>Whilst the one to depart tightly pressed the one to re-<br>main in his arms.'</p><p>Or, still more, the Poet's apostrophe 'To a Stranger':—</p><p>'Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look <br>upon you.'</p><p>Most of all this yearning for sympathy shines forth when it is recognised 'Among the Multitude;' when, in other words, the Poet foresees it, thus—</p><p>'Among the men and women, the multitude<br>I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,<br>Acknowledging none else—not parent, wife, husband, <br>brother, child, any nearer than I am:<br>Some are baffled—But that one is not—that one knows <br>me.<br>Ah! lover and perfect equal!<br>I meant that you should discover me so, by my faint <br>indirections;<br>And I, when I meet you, mean to discover you by the <br>like in you.'</p><p>So, too, he sees them afar off in foreign lands, those breasts with whom his own could sympathise could they be brought into communion:—</p><p>'O I know we should be brethren and lovers—<br>I know I should be happy with them.'</p><p>It were idle, however, attempting to afford the reader any adequate notion of these poems as a symmetrical whole, through mere fragmentary or incidental quotations like those to which a reviewer is necessarily restricted. It would be worse than the proffering of the specimen-brick by the house-vendor in Hierocles—it would be the production of a handful of splinters chipped off the Apollo Belvidere, or of a stray finger torn from the Venus de Medici. Whitman's Poems—as is the case with every true work of art—must be viewed each in its entirety before there can be any hope whatever of their accurate appreciation. So regarded, they cannot fail by any possibility, as we conceive, to win the admiration to which they are so signally entitled. After this fashion alone—that is to say at once, searchingly and comprehensively—ought at any time to be examined, that noble apostrophe, beginning at page 310, To Death, that profound and heart-penetrating epitome of Human Life, commencing at page 356, that no less effective and affecting poem upon Night and Death which opens at page 266, but above all the magnificent Nocturn upon the Death of President Lincoln beginning at page 301, and, what is to our mind even finer than that, the exquisitely pathetic and pre-eminently beautiful celebration by Walt Whitman of the first revelation to himself of his own powers and future path in life as a poet, when, as a little barefooted child, he stood upon the sea-shore one evening and far on into the night, listening to the lamentations of the song-bird bereaved of its mate, himself drowned in tears as he listened—standing, there, entranced in the moonlight drinking in the music of that delicate and tender death-chant! Never before was the song of a bird so put into human language—never before was the rapturous anguish of the poetic summons so articulated. It is Béranger's Ma Vocation repeated: when—speaking of himself as a mere infant—the old Chansonnier sings to us—</p><p>'Une plainte touchante,<br>De ma bouche sortit;<br>Le bon Dieu me dit: Chante,<br>Chante, pauvre petit.'</p><p>And now that Whitman has sung (and is still, for that matter, happily singing in the midst of us) in obedience to the holy mandate by which every true poet is at the outset made aware of his vocation, he has as profound a sense of the reality of that summons, and of the consequent permanence or security of his reputation as a Poet, as ever Horace had when proudly forecasting his own poetic immortality. Assuming to himself at once his right position in English Literature, he has even, as it happens, like almost all the more remarkable poets in our language, selected, unconsciously it may be, but unmistakably his own special emblem! Henceforth, as it seems to us, his inalienably and no other's! A floral emblem to be worn by him from this time forth as conspicuously as the sprig of bloom fastened of old on the helmet of the first Plantaganet. In this, as we have just now intimated, it is with him, as it has been before him with his compeer and his congeners, the majority of the great poets in our language. Has not Moore, for example, in this way taken to himself for ever as his the shamrock—and Scott the purpling heather—and Campbell the red velvet strings of love-lies-bleeding? Has not Keats his sprig of basil—and Blair his branch of funereal yew—and Chatterton his trail of lamenting willow? But that Burns, again, according [to] his own showing, was endowed by his Muse (the Muse of Scotland) with the glistening bough of the holly, he might perchance have contested with Dan Chaucer the latter's now undisputed right to the possession as his of the darling blossom of the daisy. As indubitably, moreover, as the daisy belongs to Chaucer and the holly to Burns—so has Shelley assumed to himself the sensitive plant, and Wordsworth the little celandine and the daffodils, and Cowper the rose and the water lily, and Leigh Hunt the flowering branch of May, and Tennyson the gorgeous blossom of the passion flower, if only by right of the 'splendid tear' shed upon it at the garden porch in 'Maud,' and Milton 'the yellow cowslip and the pale primrose,' and Shakespeare, for that matter, almost every bloom of the parterre or of the wilderness. And, as it has been with those, so it is now and henceforth with this true American Poet Walt Whitman, who has made the lilac—the fragrant, blueish-pink blossoms of the lilac—his own completely. Turning the leaves of these poems, the reader may say before the book is closed as the Poet himself says or rather sings with a sort of rapture—</p><p>'Yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me.'</p><p>For it blossoms, and breathes forth its haunting perfume, and verdantly unfolds its delicate heart-shaped leaves, again and again, all through these pages—more especially in the great Nocturn on the Death of President Lincoln. And so, with the fragrance of the lilacs in our nostrils, and with the song of the lamenting bird in our ears, and with the thought in our hearts of the manly poet himself going his sickening rounds in the ghastly hospitals, all through the great American War, accompanied, as he went down the wards, by his attendant, bearing sponge, and pail, and lint, and ointment, for the cleansing and the binding up of many loathsome wounds, we close this beautiful volume with a renewal of our grateful acknowledgments to Mr. Rossetti, and with a benison to Walt Whitman.</p>",

	"title": "Poems by Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p><strong>POEMS BY WALT WHITMAN.*</strong></p><p>Englishmen know nothing of Walt (Walter) Whitman, except the occasional brilliant scraps which English papers copy from their American contemporaries. Englishmen know nothing—excepting the very few cultivated Englishmen who have crossed the Atlantic, met the author, and learned to admire him and his books. Mr. William Michael Rossetti has been for some time what may be called a disciple of Whitman. If he did not absolutely discover him, he was at least one of the very first who heard of the discovery. Here is the result: a volume, a selection of Mr. Whitman's poems, containing probably one-half of what he has written, and that half not necessarily the best. And here it must be said, that having read the volume with great interest—for Rumour had been busy—and with deep gratification, for the present we must suffer description to assume the place of criticism, since one reading is quite insufficient, and time is required in order that the strangeness of the beauty may be absorbed and assimilated, before any proper estimate of it could be formed. It is strange, at the outset, to find that the other half of the author's writings is so disfigured by violation of morality and decency, as to be rather too much for the English reader; and, stranger still, to hear Mr. Rossetti praying for a complete edition. As far as can be made out, Mr. Whitman considers everything noble, because of divine origin, and everything a fair subject for words. Therefore he goes on about matters fleshly, spiritual, and mixed—always calling spades spades, in a fashion not to be tolerated by ordinary nerves. It will be observed that the volume is called 'Poems,' and it is certain that not one man in a thousand would so describe them. And yet we can say that there is not one page which is not thoroughly poetic. The simple thing is, not that there is no rhyme—which is, of course, unessential; but that there is no rhythm, no measure, no attempt at complying with any of the universally known demands of versification, and which we are still simple enough to consider one of the absolute demands of poetry. A skin of kid is not a kid glove. This is a dilemma which the ordinary English reader will find difficult to get over; but he must read Mr. Rossetti's prefatory sketch, which is in every way an excellent piece of writing from an accomplished man, and which seems to err only on the side of absolute infatuation. Mr. Rossetti insists that it must be taken as an altogether new poetry: as something as distinctively American as Niagara and the Rocky Mountains, and having no more in common with English poetry than Niagara has with the dripping well at Hastings, or the Rocky Mountains with Primrose-hill! A specimen or two of these strange productions shall be given; but it is proper to say that they are amongst the most musical we can find, and the easiest to understand. The author is always mystical—always democratic—always speaking in ghastly praise of death. But he roams over every or any kind of subject, and seems always to be in 'communion with nature.' He chatters with the birds, and is sometimes as incomprehensible. And he hurls large sayings at the mountains, who echo back peal after peal, and all of which enthusiasts are humbly entreated to suppose that the author understands! Here is an exquisitely musical little piece, the commencement of President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn:—</p><p>When lilacs last in the door-yard bloomed,<br>And the great star early drooped in the western sky in <br>the night,<br>I mourned…and yet shall mourn with ever-returning <br>spring.<br>O ever-returning spring! trinity sure to me you bring;<br>Lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,<br>And thought of him I love.</p><p>O powerful, western, fallen star!<br>O shades of night! O moody, tearful night!<br>O great star disappeared! O the black murk that hides <br>the star!<br>O cruel hands that hold me powerless! O helpless soul <br>of me!<br>O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul!</p><p>In the door-yard, fronting an old farm-house, near the <br>whitewashed palings,<br>Stands the lilac bush, tall-growing, with heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>With many a pointed blossom, rising delicate, with the <br>perfume strong I love,<br>With every leaf a miracle; and from this bush in the<br> door-yard,<br>With delicate-coloured blossoms, and heart-shaped <br>leaves of rich green,<br>A sprig, with its flower, I break.</p><p>In the swamp, in secluded recesses,<br>A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.<br>Solitary, the thrush,<br>The hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settle-<br>ments,<br>Sings by himself a song.<br>Song of the bleeding throat!<br>Death's outlet song of life—for well, dear brother, I <br>know,<br>If thou wast not gifted to sing, thou would surely die.</p><p>Page after page of this curiously poetical 'Funeral Hymn' might be reprinted here, for the reader's pleasure; but our object is to provoke, not to appease, the taste. Here is another short piece which is perfect—that is, complete. In it may be seen with what brilliant novelty the poet can handle the grimmest possible of all earthly and spiritual subjects:—</p><p><em>TO ONE SHORTLY TO DIE.</em><br>From all the rest I single out you, having a message for <br>you;<br>You are to die—Let others tell you what they please, I <br>cannot prevaricate,<br>I am exact and merciless; but I love you—there is no <br>escape for you.</p><p>Softly I lay my right hand upon you—you just feel it;<br>I do not argue—I bend my head close, and half-<br> envelop it,<br>I sit quietly by—I remain faithful,<br>I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbour,<br>I absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodily<br> —that is eternal—<br>The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.<br>The sun bursts through in unlooked for directions!<br>Strong thoughts fill you, and confidence—you smile!<br>You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick.<br>You do not see the medicines—you do not mind the<br> weeping friends—I am with you.<br>I exclude others from you—there is nothing to be com- <br>miserated,<br>I do not commiserate—I congratulate you.</p><p>Let people quarrel as they please about what is or is not poetry; but Mr. Walt Whitman is beyond all question a poet.</p><p>* 'Poems by Walt Whitman.'

	"body": "<p><em>Poems</em>. By Walt Whitman. Selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti (Hotten.)</p><p>THE selections here given from the poems of Walt Whitman form, we are told, nearly half of his entire works. Mr. Rossetti's objects in the present compilation have been, first, to exclude every poem that could fairly be deemed offensive; and, secondly, to include whatever, being free from just or unjust censure on the ground of decorum, is at the same time highest as poetry and most characteristic of the writer. The editor has wisely, and with a proper reverence for one in whose genius he believes, refrained from culling what are called 'beauties' from such poems as might be thought objectionable. He has hacked and spoilt no piece by depriving it of the unity and continuity which make it vital; and thus, though we have not here the whole of Whitman, what we have is genuinely his own. It follows from the process adopted that we are not now called upon to weigh the accusations which have been brought against the writer in America for his license of expression in morals (morals being, of course, to be understood in a special and restricted sense), but simply to examine his credentials as a poet.</p><p>In a Preface which, on the whole, is written with his usual discernment and happiness of exposition, Mr. Rossetti observes of Whitman, 'He may be termed formless by those who, not without much reason to show for themselves, are wedded to the established forms and ratified refinements of poetic art; but it seems reasonable to enlarge the canon till it includes so great and startling a genius, rather than to draw it close and exclude him.' We see, however, no reason why the usual definition of an art should be changed for the sake of embracing in its limits one who might otherwise stand without them. The question now at issue, is not whether Mr. Whitman is a great thinker, but whether he is a great poet. Now, by common consent the vital constituents of poetry are emotion and imagination. By imagination we mean the power of conceiving ideas and of representing them by adequate symbols to the senses.</p><p>Judged by this admitted test, what shall we say of Walt Whitman? That some entire poems in this collection, and many scattered passages in other poems, bear the test triumphantly, few, if qualified to judge, will doubt. On the other hand, we have here many pages (probably the greater number) of which it would be difficult to maintain that they are poetry in any sense of that word which has yet been accepted. Thus, in the address 'To Working Men,' who can say that, however exalted by the prevailing idea of the piece, any item in the following catalogue, with the one exception marked in italics, is in itself poetical?—</p><p>House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin- roofing, shingle-dressing,Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flagging <br>of side-walks by flaggers,<br>The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal- <br>kiln and brick-kiln,<br>Coal-mines, and all that is down there,—the lamps in the <br>darkness, echoes, songs, what meditations, what <br>vast native thoughts looking through smutched faces,<br>Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the river-<br> banks—men around feeling the melt with huge <br>crowbars—lumps of ore, the due combining of ore, <br>limestone, coal—the blast-furnace and the puddling- <br>furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom of the melt at <br>last—the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron,<br> the strong, clean-shaped T-rail for railroads;<br>Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house, <br>steam-saws, the great mills and factories.</p><p>Even in the composition called 'A Poet,' which, besides its high strain of thought, is very interesting as a revelation of Whitman's individuality, there is far more of theory than of imagination. When he writes of the poet—</p><p>Him all wait for—him all yield up to—his word is deci-<br>sive and final,<br>Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, <br>as amid light,<br>Him they immerse, and he immerses them.<br>Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the land-<br>scape, people, animals,<br>The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet <br>ocean (so tell I my morning's romanza),<br>All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever <br>money will buy,<br>The best farms—others toiling and planting, and he <br>unavoidably reaps,<br>The noblest and costliest cities—others grading and build-<br>ing, and he domiciles there,<br>Nothing for anyone, but what is for him—near and far <br>are for him,—the ships in the offing,<br>The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if <br>they are for anybody—</p><p>the reader may or may not find in the lines truth of doctrine, but he assuredly will not find beauty of expression. Turning, on the contrary, to the pieces named respectively 'Assimilations,' 'Burial,' 'The Waters,' 'A Ship,' 'President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn,' and 'A Word out of the Sea,' he will scarcely deny that they possess striking truth and beauty of description, and, still better, that subtle and informing power which unobtrusively converts all outward things into symbols, just as the soul makes for itself a symbol of the body which it pervades and rules. This unconscious power of symbolization—quite distinct from, and even opposed to, the mechanical ingenuity of allegory—is nowhere more delightfully evinced by Whitman than in 'A Word out of the Sea,' to our thinking the poem of the book. A boy discovers a bird's-nest in some briars that skirt the sea-shore. Day after day he watches the movements of the male bird and his mate, listens to the singing and the chirping by which they express their happiness. At length,</p><p>May-be killed unknown to her mate,<br>One forenoon the she-bird crouched not on the nest,<br>Nor returned that afternoon, nor the next,<br>Nor ever returned again.</p><p>The boy continues to note the solitary bird flitting restlessly from spot to spot on the shore, and at times pouring forth a mournful song, the desolation, the longing and the brief beguiling hope of which the listener translates into human speech. To the boy's ear the bird sings as follows:—</p><p>Soothe! soothe! soothe!<br>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,<br>And again another behind, embracing and lapping, every <br>one close,—<br>But my love soothes not me, not me.</p><p>Low hangs the moon—it rose late;<br>O it is lagging—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.</p><p>O madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,<br>With love—with love.</p><p>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out there among <br>the breakers?<br>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?</p><p>Loud! loud! loud!<br>Loud I call to you, my love!<br>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves;<br>Surely you must know who is here, is here;<br>You must know who I am, my love.</p><p>Low-hanging moon!<br>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?<br>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!<br>O moon, do not keep her from me any longer!</p><p>Land! land! O land!<br>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my <br>mate back again, if you only would;<br>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</p><p>O rising stars!<br>Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with <br>some of you.</p><p>O throat! O trembling throat!<br>Sound clearer through the atmosphere!<br>Pierce the woods, the earth;<br>Somewhere, listening to catch you, must be the one I want.</p><p>Shake out, carols!<br>Solitary here—the night's carols!<br>Carols of lonesome love! Death's carols!<br>Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!<br>O, under that moon, where she droops almost down into<br> the sea!<br>O reckless, despairing carols!</p><p>But soft! sink low;<br>Soft! let me just murmur;<br>And do you wait a moment, you husky-noised sea;<br>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to<br> me,<br>So faint—I must be still, be still to listen;<br>But not altogether still, for then she might not come <br>immediately to me.</p><p>Hither, my love!<br>Here I am! Here!<br>With this just-sustained note I announce myself to you;<br>This gentle call is for you, my love, for you!</p><p>Do not be decoyed elsewhere!<br>That is the whistle of the wind—it is not my voice;<br>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray;<br>Those are the shadows of leaves.</p><p>O darkness! O in vain!<br>O I am very sick and sorrowful!<br>O brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon <br>the sea!<br>O troubled reflection in the sea!<br>O throat! O throbbing heart!<br>O all!—and I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night!</p><p>Yet I murmur, murmur on!<br>O murmurs—you yourselves make me continue to sing, I <br>know not why.</p><p>O past! O life! O songs of joy!<br>In the air—in the woods—over fields;<br>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!<br>But my love no more, no more with me!<br>We two together no more!</p><p>The plaint of the bird arouses in the boy, too, the sense of something missed and yearned for. A joy has vanished from the soul as its mate from the bird. Shall the ideal of youth that has taken wing return to earth no more? Shall the yearning for it ever be satisfied, and by what?—</p><p>Answering, the Sea,<br>Delaying not, hurrying not,<br>Whispered me through the night and very plainly before<br> daybreak,<br>Lisped to me the low and delicious word DEATH.</p><p>Of the sublimated passion and sweetness of the above, of the minuteness with which the most delicate transitions of feeling are caught, and of the grand yet melancholy suggestiveness which sets the whole picture, as it were, in a frame of sad sunset glory, we can hardly speak in terms of praise too high. That Whitman can write noble poetry, this one example conclusively testifies.Of the writer, generally, it may be said, that he is universal in his sympathies, (with the sole exception that he cannot recognize the possibility of goodness in any man who happens to be born an aristocrat,)—that (with this exception) he believes in the capacity for virtue, latent or developed, of all his fellows—believes that the best man is but the full and perfected expression of the worth and power hidden in the worst,—believes that in point of art it is right to express in speech all that is true in fact, and to regard all processes and things, natural or mechanical, that have once been associated with man as sanctified thereby. The 'homo sum' and the deductions drawn from it, have never found a more zealous advocate.</p><p>It is difficult to describe a mind so varied and yet so peculiar in a few phrases. Yet we will venture to designate Mr. Whitman as a wide, sincere, passionate thinker,—presenting in himself a new combination of separate views, which are not particularly new in themselves. This is not said to his disadvantage, for truisms, after all, lie at the root of the world's progress. The expansiveness of his mind includes imagination, no doubt, but rather as a constituent than as a characteristic. He resembles those vast tracts of country in which is found the utmost diversity of surface, and in which long intervals of homely or even barren scenery precede and succeed glorious manifestations of Nature. He is so large and generic in his mode of thinking that he often scatters beauty in the seed rather than reveals it in the flowers; at other times, nothing can surpass the truthful minuteness with which he paints the most delicate nuances of feeling. He is a fine poet, though it would be a great error to say that all is poetry to which he has given the name.For a brief and excellent summary of Whitman's life and writings, we refer the reader to Mr. Rossetti's Preface—a composition disfigured only by a somewhat puerile display of contempt for his fellow critics. His allegations against them may or may not be just; but their errors, if real, would have been more gracefully improved by that superior example which Mr. Rossetti so consciously affords, than by his unnecessary invectives.</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman's Poems",
	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S POEMS.*</strong></p><p>SOME years ago, when a few copies of a volume called Leaves of Grass found their way into this country from America, the general verdict of those who had an opportunity of examining the book was that much of it was indescribably filthy, most of it mere incoherent rhapsody, none of it what could be termed poetry in any sense of the word, and that, unless at the hands of some enterprising Holywell Street publisher, it had no chance of the honour of an English reprint. In part this opinion is already proved to have been a mistaken one, for a West-end publisher has taken compassion on the stranger, and now presents it to the British public in a comely form. It may be as well to state at the outset, that the volume published by Mr. Hotten is not precisely a reprint of the original Leaves of Grass. It contains much new matter written since the appearance of that work, and does not contain any of the pieces marked by that peculiar freedom of speech which is generally associated in men's minds with the name of Walt Whitman. For the sake of all parties, the prurient as well as the prudish, lest the one should be unnecessarily alarmed or the other led into an unremunerative venture, it is only fair to say that there is nothing in the present edition to disqualify it for decent society, not to say qualify it for a place in the Bibliothèque bleue. It has cost Mr. Rossetti severe pangs, so he informs us, to part with so much as, from considerations of prudence, he has been obliged to exclude. 'This peculiarly nervous age,' this 'mealy-mouthed British nineteenth century,' with its present absurd notions about decency, morality, and propriety, could not be expected to receive 'the indecencies scattered through Whitman's writings' in that æsthetic spirit in which they should be accepted; and, as he was unwilling to mutilate, 'the consequence is that the reader loses in toto several important poems, and some extremely fine ones—notably one of quite exceptional value and excellence, entitled Walt Whitman.' In one respect we are willing to admit the loss sustained in this last instance. The 'poem' here referred to is the one which contains the key to Walt Whitman's philosophy and poetic theory. It is in it that he describes himself and his qualifications for the office of poet of the future, grounding his claim upon the fact of his being 'hankering, gross, mystical, nude, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshy, sensual, no more modest than immodest'; and proposing to produce poetry of corresponding qualities, a promise which we must say he most conscientiously fulfils. Its excellence may be open to question, but about its value to the reader who wishes to understand Walt Whitman there can be no doubt whatever.</p><p>The present edition is to be considered as an experiment. By excluding everything offensive, the editor hopes to induce people to reconsider the case of Walt Whitman, and reverse the verdict which has been already pronounced. This, we need scarcely observe, is rather more than they can be fairly asked to do, while the evidence which supports the gravest of the charges brought against him is suppressed. But this is not all that Mr. Rossetti expects. The present selection is so to brace and fortify the British mind that in a short time, he trusts, it will be able to relish what now in its weakness it rejects. A complete edition of Walt Whitman, with all the dirt left in, he looks forward to as 'the right and crowning result' of his labours. This is but the schoolboy's pudding, which, if we only finish it off, is to be succeeded by a full meal of the uncommonly strong meat he has in reserve for us. A fellow-countryman of the poet's, who had unsuccessfully besieged the virtue of a married lady, is said to have consoled himself with the reflection that, at any rate, he had 'lowered her moral tone some.' Though he himself had not gained his point, his labours, he thought, had diminished the difficulties in the way of the next comer. Something of this sort appears to be the modest mission of the present volume. We must confess we should very much prefer to see Mr. Rossetti employing himself on some task more worthy of his abilities. He has on many occasions done good service as a critic to literature and art, but we cannot look upon his present enterprise as one in any way beneficial to either. He desires to have Walt Whitman recognised, not merely as a great poet, but as the founder of a new school of poetic literature which is to be greater and more powerful than any the world has yet seen. He is not, it is true, entirely alone in this attempt. There have been already certain indications of a Walt Whitman movement in one or two other quarters. More than a year ago there was a paper in the Fortnightly Review, which, however, was not so much a criticism of his poetry as of his person, the writer having had, as well as we recollect, the privilege of reviewing him as he bathed—an important advantage, certainly, in the case of a poet whose principal theme is his own body. Then Mr. Robert Buchanan took him up in the Broadway magazine, and, saying nearly all that has ever been said against Walt Whitman—that he is no poet and no artist, that he is gross, monotonous, loud, obscure, prone to coarse animalism and to talking rank nonsense—nevertheless arrived at pretty much the same conclusion as Mr. Rossetti, at least as to the powerful influence he is to exercise over the literature of the future. Something of this sort we might, indeed, have expected. There are people whose reading of the Horatian saying about popular opinion is 'nunquam vulgus rectum videt,' and who always set themselves to find virtues in everything that is generally condemned. Besides, it would be idle to deny that Walt Whitman has many attractions for minds of a certain class. He is loud, swaggering, and self-assertive, and so gets credit for strength with those who worship nothing that is not strong. He is utterly lawless, and in consequence passes for being a great original genius. His produce is unlike anything else that has ever appeared in literature, and that is enough for those who are always on the look-out for novelty. He is rich in all those qualities of haziness, incoherence, and obscurity which seem to be the first that some readers nowadays look for in poetry. But, above all, he runs amuck with conventionalities and decencies of every sort, which naturally endears him to those silly people who take a childish delight in seeing the respectabilities of the world pulled by the nose, and what they consider its stupid prejudices shocked. We need scarcely say we do not suspect a man of Mr. Rossetti's taste and judgment of this kind of enthusiasm. If we were to hazard a theory, we should be inclined to attribute his advocacy of Walt Whitman's poetical claims to an impatience of the feebleness, emptiness, and sentimentality so abundant in modern poetry. The feeling is one with which we do not quarrel; we only object to the form in which it finds expression. A plague of tinkling cymbals is not to be met by a counter treatment of sounding brass.</p><p>An admirer of Walt Whitman has one immense advantage. There is no standard by which his idol can be measured, no known test which can be applied to prove his quality. There is, therefore, a wide field for that dogmatic assertion which is the favourite argument of the transcendental critic. You must not object that his poetry has no melody, music, or form. It is something above and beyond all requirements of that kind. You are not to raise the objection that in a great deal of what he writes there is no meaning at all, and in a great deal more the meaning, when got at, is utterly commonplace. Poetry like Walt Whitman's is not to be judged of by any one who is influenced by narrow considerations of meaning. You are not to take exception to his language, that it is a vile jargon of his own coining. A poet of this order naturally rises above the trammels of precedent in the matter of language. As to the absence of imagination, invention, fancy, art, and sundry other things more or less looked for in poetry, to complain of this in the present instance only shows that you are incapable of understanding the subject. This sort of argument always tells powerfully with the timid, with those people who are haunted by a nervous dread of being set down as dull and commonplace if they allow common sense to influence their judgment; and besides, it has the merit of being unanswerable, except by contradiction. When a man shows you something with all the outward and visible signs of a wheelbarrow, and tells you it is an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to know what to say to him; and it is just as hard to know what to say when you are offered something like the following and told it is poetry, and poetry of a very high order. As the admirers of Walt Whitman always protest against his being judged of fragmentarily, we take the shortest poem we can find, instead of giving the queerest extract:—</p><p><em>VISAGES.</em><br>Of the visages of things—And of piercing through to the accepted hells <br>beneath.<br>Of ugliness—To me there is just as much in it as there is in beauty— <br>And now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me.<br>Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are not, in any respect, <br>worse than undetected persons—and are not in any respect worse than <br>I am myself.<br>Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal—and <br>any reputable person is also—and the President is also.</p><p>Now it may be that this is not balderdash, though we must confess to a strong suspicion that it is; but if it is poetry, all we can say is, we must find some other word for Shakespeare. Walt Whitman himself is much more candid on this point than his advocates. He certainly declares himself to be a poet, but at the same time he describes the offspring of his muse as a 'barbaric yawp.' We have no very definite idea as to the precise nature of a yawp, but, whatever it may be, it can scarcely be poetry.</p><p>We must do Mr. Rossetti the justice of admitting that he does not entirely rely on dogmatism in pleading the cause of his protégé. He does assign some few reasons why Walt Whitman should be accepted as 'the poet of the epoch.' In a paper which appeared in a weekly journal, he puts the claim on the rather curious ground of his being 'an initiator in the scheme and structure of his writings, and an individual of audacious personal ascendant.' But in the preface to the present volume he comes more plainly to the point. The reader, he says, is not to ask himself, or return any answer to the questions, whether or not Walt Whitman is like other poets, or whether or not the particular application of rules of art which is found to hold good in the works of other poets, and to constitute a part of their excellence, can be traced also in his work. 'Let the questions rather be—Is he powerful? Is he American? Is he new? Is he rousing? Does he feel, and make me feel?' To each of these questions we should be disposed to answer simply 'No,' were it not that an unqualified negative is scarcely polite. We can see no reason for considering Walt Whitman powerful. Strong he may be, but it is only in the sense in which an onion is strong. His noise, bluster, and arrogance are no more indications of true strength than the swagger of the professional athlete at a country fair, who struts up and down the stage in salmon-coloured tights, and passes for a Hercules with the crowd from the way in which he feels his muscles in public. That he is American in one sense we must admit. He is something which no other country could have produced. He is American as certain forms of rowdyism and vulgarity, excrescences on American institutions, are American. But that he is American in the sense of being representative of American taste, intellect, or cultivation, we should be very sorry indeed to believe. New he certainly is, but it is only in his audacity, and in the abnormal structure of his poetry; there is not a new thought in his writings from beginning to end. As to the other questions, the answer must depend very much on individual temperament. Whether or not he himself feels we cannot tell, but, so far from being rousing or making his reader feel, we should say that with ninety-nine out of a hundred average readers Walt Whitman, taken in any quantity, would be found to be about as soporific a poet as ever produced a yawn. But even if all these questions could be answered in the affirmative—even if we were to concede that Walt Whitman is powerful and new and American and rousing, and throw into the bargain what his friends invariably lay great stress upon, his magnificent physique and his irreproachable character in private life—still all this, we submit, does not make him out to be a poet. To call a man a poet merely because he holds forth in rhapsodical style about one man being as good as another, everything being all right, every one having a right 'to do as he dam pleases'—if we may venture to quote the concise language of Transatlantic liberty—and other dogmas of the same sort, is to confuse the functions of the poet and the stump orator; and generally, when Walt Whitman has any meaning at all, it amounts to no more than this. Very often he has no meaning whatever. In his fury he breaks out into a mere perspiration of words, and strings substantives together for pages on a stretch, the result being a something which is as much like poetry as an auctioneer's catalogue. To be sure there is scattered through his pages a vast amount of that vagueness which to some tastes has the true poetic charm. No doubt there are people who consider this sort of thing very fine:</p><p><em>OF THE TERRIBLE DOUBT OF APPEARANCES.</em><br>The skies of day and night—colours, densities, forms—May-be these are <br>(as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has <br>yet to be known;</p><p>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) <br>as from my present point of view—And might prove (as of course <br>they would) naught of what they appear, or naught any how, from <br>entirely changed points of view.</p><p>But if it is very fine, then so is Miss Codger's outburst on being introduced to Elijah Pogram:—</p><p>But why we call them so, or why impressed they are, or if impressed they are at all, or if at all we are, or if there really is, oh gasping one! a Pogram or a Hominy, or any active principle, to which we give those titles, is a topic, spirit-searching, light-abandoned, much too vast to enter on.</p><p>But of course the special charm of Walt Whitman is that he is so—what his admirers call unconventional; that is, that he says things which other people do not say, and in language which other people do not generally use. His unconventionality, however, is of a very cheap sort. It is nothing more than the unconventionality of the man who considers clothes conventional, and goes about without them. It is true that for the present we are spared the bolder strokes of his genius in this respect, but, as has been already mentioned, it is only for the present; and besides, Walt Whitman's grossness is not accidental, but constitutional. It arises partly from an insensibility to the difference between that which is naturally offensive and that which is not, partly from his peculiar theory of poetry. As it is a fundamental principle of his to recognise no law of any kind, and to submit to no restrictions of artistic propriety, it follows that with him all subjects are equally fit for poetic treatment. As Mr. Rossetti puts it, 'he knows of no reason why what is universally seen and known, necessary and right, should not also be allowed and proclaimed in speech,' and it is just this ignorance of his which, independently of other reasons, makes any attempt to set him up as a poetic model mischievous to the interests of literary art. It is not a question of squeamishness or hyper sensitiveness. There is no prudery in objecting to nastiness, nor is there any originality, honesty, manliness, or courage in obtruding what even instinct teaches us to avoid. We cannot say, however, that we anticipate any serious injury to English or American literature from the influence or popularity of Walt Whitman's poetry, so long at least as people are courageous enough to use their common sense, and do not allow themselves to be led away by transcendental 'high-falutin' into pretending an admiration which they do not feel.</p><p>∗ Poems by Walt Whitman.

	"body": "<p>Of the republication of Walt Whitman's poems in England, Mr. Smalley writes to the Tribune:</p><p>'The writings of Walt Whitman, which, on the title page of the English reprint, are described as poems, are reviewed this week in The Athenæum, with more respect than the English press has generally accorded to them. Mr. Dixon's paper thinks some entire pieces embody the vital constituents of poetry, viz., emotion and imagination; though of the greater number of pages it would be difficult to maintain that they are poetry in any sense of that word which has yet been accepted. The poem of the book is considered to be 'A Word out of the Sea,' which 'conclusively testifies that Whitman can write noble poetry.' This, however, is a verdict, not upon the whole writings of Mr. Whitman, but upon so many of them as his editor, Mr. W. M. Rossetti, has thought it prudent to put into English print. No publisher could be found—not even Mr. Swinburne's—willing to affront both the law and public sense of decency by an unexpurgated issue of writings which owe their toleration in America to their obscurity. In private, Mr. Whitman has been more or less a topic of discussion. I have never yet heard, from any competent source, a favorable opinion on his claims. I have heard but one such opinion from any English source whatever, and that was from a poet whose critical judgment may have yielded to his sympathy with the worst eccentricities of Whitman's muse. But there is plenty of stern criticism from men who are usually tolerant, and of contemptuous criticism from men who are usually merciful. Mr. Carlyle likens him to a buffalo, useful in fertilizing the soil, but mistaken in supposing that his contributions of that sort are matters which the world desires to contemplate closely.'</p>",

	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>FAINT praise may harm the prose-writer, but there is nothing which predisposes us against a poet so much as extravagant praise; if we are not very young, and have little enthusiasm to spare about anything, we especially resent it. The unreasonable laudation (now so common) makes us as unreasonably despise its object. 'As it is impossible to conceive a world without a Shakespeare, so we cannot picture it to ourselves without this new sweet singer, Jones.' Bother Jones! We that have known Keats and Shelley, and Byron, and Wordsworth and Coleridge, to be told that there has been no such poet as Jones!</p><p>Not a little ludicrous eulogy of this sort has been poured of late upon the American poet whose name stands at the head of this paper, but he is really noteworthy nevertheless. He is the first characteristic poetical writer that the United States have produced. Longfellow is but Tennyson and water; and as for the other Transatlantic bards, they have produced solitary poems of great merit, but none which might not have been written by an Englishman of genius, who had paid great attention to the panoramas of the Mississippi or of the Prairies which have been unfolded from time to time in Leicester Square. Whitman's very faults are national. The brag, and bluster, and self-assertion of the man are American only; the fulsome 'cracking-up' of his own nation is such as would not be ventured upon by a British bard; the frequent bathos—the use of newspaper terms and of terms which have no existence out of New York, and in which you almost hear the American nasal twang, are all characteristic. He is Yankee to the backbone; Yankee, also, it must however be added, in his outspoken independence of thought, in his audacious originality, in his perfect freedom from conventional twaddle, and in his contempt for accidental rank of all sorts. He has named half his volume Chants Democratic, and though they are not chants, nor anything like it, they are certainly democratic. He does not write verse at all, which is fortunate, for he would certainly not be particular about his rhymes; nor does he even write blank verse; but he has invented a certain rolling changeful metre of his own, with, as his English editor∗ truly remarks, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense throughout.' He sometimes furnishes long strings of detached items—very like the list of goods furnished by shops to their customers; but they are 'not devoid of a certain primitive effectiveness' by any means.</p><p>The doctrine of nihil humanum, &c. was never pushed to such extreme limits as by Walt Whitman. If a man could gain the suffrages of the human race by flattering them with the sense of their tremendous importance, this poet would be king of the world.</p><p>Small is the theme of the following chant, yet the <br>greatest—namely, ONE'S-SELF; that wondrous <br>thing, a simple separate person. That, for the <br>use of the New World, I sing.<br>Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. <br>Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is <br>worthy for the Muse: I say the form complete <br>is worthier far. The female equally with the <br>male I sing.<br>Nor cease at the theme of One's-self. I speak the <br>word of the modern, the word En Masse.</p><p>Such is Mr Whitman's programme. If he did not speak 'the word of the modern' quite so often, or, at least, not borrow it from the penny-a-liner, it would be better for his fame. Also, through singing 'Man's physiology complete,' he has caused Mr Rossetti to be at the trouble of preparing the present 'Bowdlerised,' or excised edition of his works, to suit the squeamish tastes of the Old Country. So please, ladies, be particular to ask for the above-mentioned edition. There is nothing in that which you may not read, or the book would not be noticed in these columns.</p><p>Whitman's poetry reminds us, as we have said, of no other poet, but in his prose we seem to recognise some kinship to Emerson's. Here is a fine passage from the preface to his Leaves of Grass [the titles of his poems are unattractive, being almost always affected or unmeaning], insisting upon the importance of human act, word, thought, and the indestructibility of their results.</p><p>All that a person does or thinks is of consequence. Not a move can a man or woman make that affects him or her in a day or a month, or any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death, but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime. The indirect is always as great and real as the direct. The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body. Not one name of word or deed …not of the putrid veins of gluttons or rum-drinkers …not peculation, or cunning, or betrayal, or murder …no serpentine poison of those that seduce women …not the foolish yielding of women …not of the attainment of gain by discreditable means …not any nastiness of appetite …not any harshness of officers to men, or judges to prisoners, or fathers to sons, or sons to fathers, or of husbands to wives, or bosses to their boys …not of greedy looks or malignant wishes …nor any of the wiles practised by people upon themselves …ever is or ever can be stamped on the programme, but it is duly realised and returned, and that returned in further performances, and they returned again. Nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason, whether it bring arguments to hand or no. No specification is necessary …to add, or subtract, or divide is in vain. Little or big, learned or unlearned, white or black, legal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or female does that is vigorous, and benevolent, and clean, is so much sure profit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the whole scope of it for ever. If the savage or felon is wise, it is well …if the greatest poet or savant is wise, it is simply the same …if the President or chief-justice is wise, it is the same …if the young mechanic or farmer is wise, it is no more or less. The interest will come round …all will come round. All the best actions of war and peace …all help given to relatives and strangers, and the poor, and old, and sorrowful, and young children, and widows, and the sick, and to all shunned persons …all furtherance of fugitives and of the escape of slaves …all the self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others take the seats of the boats …all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend's sake or opinion's sake …all pains of enthusiasts scoffed at by their neighbours …all the vast sweet love and precious suffering of mothers …all honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded …all the grandeur and good of the few ancient nations whose fragments of annals we inherit …and all the good of the hundreds of far mightier and more ancient nations unknown to us by name or date or location …all that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or not …all that has at any time been well suggested out of the divine heart of man, or by the divinity of his mouth, or by the shaping of his great hands …and all that is well thought or done this day on any part of the surface of the globe, or on any of the wandering stars or fixed stars by those there as we are here …or that is henceforth to be well thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any one—these singly and wholly inured at their time, and inure now, and will inure always, to the identities from which they sprung or shall spring.</p><p>A fine lay-sermon, surely.</p><p>From common humanity our author rises to the American Citizen, with a portrait of whom he furnishes us, which will not easily be recognised by those who have only been accustomed to see English photographs of the individual in question. Other states, he says, indicate themselves by their deputies, but the United States always most in its common people.</p><p>Their manners, speech, dress, friendships—the freshness and candour of their physiognomy—the picturesque looseness of their carriage—their deathless attachment to freedom—their aversion to anything indecorous, or soft, or mean—the practical acknowledgment of the citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states—the fierceness of their roused resentment—their curiosity and welcome of novelty—their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy—their susceptibility to a slight—the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors—the fluency of their speech—their delight in music, the sure symptom of manly tenderness and native elegance of soul—their good temper and open-handedness—the terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to him—these, too, are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of it.</p><p>In the meantime, however, Walt Whitman will try his hand.</p><p>Starting from fish-shape Paumanok,† where I was <br>born,<br>Well-begotten, and raised by a perfect mother;<br>After roaming many lands—lover of populous <br>pavements;<br>Dweller in Mannahatta‡, city of ships, my city— <br>or on southern savannas;<br>Or a soldier camped, or carrying my knapsack and <br>gun—or a miner in California;<br>Or rude in my home in Dakotah's woods, my diet <br>meat, my drink from the spring;<br>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep <br>recess,<br>Far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, <br>rapt and happy;<br>Aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing Missouri <br>—aware of mighty Niagara;<br>Aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains—the <br>hirsute and strong-breasted bull;<br>Of earths, rocks, fifth-month flowers, experienced— <br>stars, rain, snow, my amaze;<br>Having studied the mocking-bird's tones, and the <br>mountain hawk's,<br>And heard at dusk the unrivalled one, the hermit <br>thrush, from the swamp-cedars,<br>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New <br>World.</p><p>He even dates from the United States era; in 1856, he writes:</p><p>In the Year 80 of the States,<br>My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from<br> this soil, this air,<br>Born here of parents born here, from parents the <br>same, and their parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-six years old, in perfect health begin,<br>Hoping to cease not till death.<br>Creeds and schools in abeyance<br>(Retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are,<br> but never forgotten),<br>I harbour, for good or bad—I permit to speak, at<br> every hazard—<br>Nature now without check, with original energy.</p><p>Yet he is so good as to say that former experience and instruction have not been altogether thrown away; he is grateful, only let it be distinctly understood, that he is under no slavish sense of obligation; that the gratitude must be reciprocal.</p><p>I conned old times;<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might <br>return and study me!</p><p>If eligible? One would think he pictured himself as an investment. You must not be put off your liking, reader, by these blots. 'Whitman is a poet who bears and needs to be read as a whole, and then the volume and torrent of his power carry the disfigurements along with it and away.' He is really a fine fellow.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophs, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or<br> desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what <br>you have left, wafted hither:<br>I have perused it—own it is admirable (moving <br>a while among it);<br>Think nothing can ever be greater—nothing can <br>ever deserve more than it deserves;<br>Regarding it all intently a long while, then<br> dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.</p><p>It is as the poet of his own day, of his own nation (as also of Humanity, though in a less degree), that Whitman is to be considered. Half a century ago, he would have been wholly unintelligible; and half a century hence, it is possible that he will be forgotten; but he will leave much seed behind him, and perhaps found a school whose pupils will be greater than their master. His messages to the Poor and Fallen (who will most certainly never receive them, by the by) are full of tenderness and fraternal love, but never of pity: why should they be pitied, who are as high as the highest, and as good as the best? Nay, even crime does not cut them off from their equality with him, or him from his sympathy with them.</p><p>If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become <br>so for your sake;<br>If you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, <br>do you think I cannot remember my own <br>foolish and outlawed deeds?<br>If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite<br> side of the table;<br>If you meet some stranger in the streets, and love <br>him or her—why, I often meet strangers in the <br>street, and love them.</p><p>Why, what have you thought of yourself?<br>Is it you then that thought yourself less?<br>Is it you that thought the President greater than you?<br>Or the rich better off than you? or the educated <br>wiser than you?<br>Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you <br>was once drunk, or a thief,<br>Or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so <br>now;<br>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no <br>scholar, and never saw your name in print,<br>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?</p><p>Whitman does not pretend to read 'the riddle of the painful earth;' but he takes leave to admire, after his fashion, the great Cosmos;</p><p>The sun and stars that float in the open air;<br>The apple-shaped earth, and we upon it—surely the<br> drift of them is something grand!<br>I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, <br>and that it is happiness,<br>And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a<br> speculation, or bon-mot, or reconnaissance,<br>And that it is not something which by luck may <br>turn out well for us, and without luck must be <br>a failure for us,<br>And not something which may yet be retracted in <br>a certain contingency.</p><p>Yet it is Man, and not external Nature, which has his worship:</p><p>When the psalm sings instead of the singer;<br>When the script preaches instead of the preacher;<br>When the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the <br>carver that carved the supporting desk;<br>When I can touch the body of books, by night or <br>by day, and when they touch my body back <br>again;<br>When a university course convinces, like a slumber-<br>ing woman and child convince;<br>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the <br>night-watchman's daughter;<br>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and <br>are my friendly companions;<br>I intend to reach them my hand, and make as <br>much of them as I do of men and women like <br>you.</p><p>The sum of all known reverence I add up in you, <br>whoever you are;<br>The President is there in the White House for you— <br>it is not you who are here for him.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>List close, my scholars dear!<br>All doctrines, all politics and civilisation, exsurge <br>from you;<br>All sculpture and monuments, and anything in-<br>scribed anywhere, are tallied in you;<br>The gist of histories and statistics, as far back as<br> the records reach, is in you this hour, and <br>myths and tales the same;<br>If you were not breathing and walking here, where <br>would they all be?<br>The most renowned poems would be ashes, orations <br>and plays would be vacuums.</p><p>Whitman is practical beyond all poets before him; and, indeed, in one sense (but not in the anti-theological one), material. It delights him to contemplate the visible instruments of labour, and he sings, in minutest detail, the works which they accomplish. The axe leaps, and the solid forest, says he, gives blind utterances, and the manifold shapes arise in his mind's eye, which are hewn out of the wood.</p><p>The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his <br>shroud;<br>The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts,<br> in the posts of the bride's bed;<br>The shape of the little trough, the shape of the <br>rockers beneath, the shape of the babe's cradle;<br>The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for <br>dancers' feet;<br>The shape of the planks of the family home, the <br>home of the friendly parents and children,<br>The shape of the roof of the home of the happy<br> young man and woman, the roof over the well- <br>married young man and woman,<br>The roof over the supper joyously cooked by the <br>chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the chaste <br>husband, content after his day's work.</p><p>The shapes arise!<br>The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-room, <br>and of him or her seated in the place;<br>The shape of the liquor-bar leaned against by the <br>young rum-drinker and the old rum-drinker;<br>The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by <br>sneaking footsteps;</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish <br>winnings and losings;<br>The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted and <br>sentenced murderer, the murderer with haggard <br>face and pinioned arms.</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances;<br>The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed and <br>in haste;<br>The door that admits good news and bad news;<br>The door whence the son left home, confident and <br>puffed up;<br>The door he entered again from a long and scandal- <br>ous absence, diseased, broken down, without <br>innocence, without means.</p><p>These picturings may be somewhat weird and fanciful, but they are expressed with power, and the conception of them is certainly original and striking. They are, however, too prolonged, and remind one of what somebody writes of the minuteness of Crabbe's verse—that he was like a broker appraising furniture.</p><p>Under the unsatisfactory title of 'Assimilations,' Whitman describes the influence of association upon the human mind, and, incidentally, depicts most graphically the surroundings and circumstances of the somewhat unenviable home in which he himself was reared.</p><p>The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on <br>the supper-table;<br>The mother with mild words—clean her cap and <br>gown, a wholesome odour falling off her person <br>and clothes as she walks by;<br><em>The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust;<br>The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the <br>crafty lure,</em><br>The family usages, the language, the company, the <br>furniture—the yearning and swelling heart,<br>Affection that will not be gainsayed—the sense of <br> what is real—the thought if after all it should <br>prove unreal,<br>The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time <br>—the curious whether and how,<br>Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all<br> flashes and specks?<br>Men and women crowding fast in the streets—if <br>they are not flashes and specks, what are they?<br>The streets themselves, and the façades of houses, <br>and goods in the windows,<br>Vehicles, teams, the heavy-planked wharfs—the <br>huge crossing at the ferries,<br>The village on the highland, seen from afar at <br>sunset—the river between,<br>Shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs <br>and gables of white or brown, three miles off,<br>The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the <br>tide—the little boat slack-towed astern,<br>The hurrying tumbling waves quick-broken crests <br>slapping,<br>The strata of coloured clouds, the long bar of <br>maroon-tint, away solitary by itself—the spread <br>of purity it lies motionless in,<br>The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fra-<br>grance of salt-marsh and shore-mud:<br>These became part of that child who went forth<br> every day, and who now goes, and will always <br>go forth every day.</p><p>In Mr Rossetti's Preface, we learn in plain prose what Walt Whitman's life has been. Walt, it appears, is merely a characteristic appellation; he was named Walter, like his father before him, who was first a farmer, afterwards a carpenter and builder (hence, doubtless, that eulogy on the axe), and an adherent to the religious principles of 'the great Quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks,' of whom, if our readers have never heard, they are no worse off than we are.</p><p>Walt—born in 1819—was schooled at Brooklyn, a suburb of New York, and began life at the age of thirteen, working as a printer, later on, as a country teacher, and then as a miscellaneous press-writer in New York.' He changed his pursuits, after the national fashion: became newspaper editor, and then builder, like his father; from 1837 to 1848, was, we fear, a rowdy, since his American biographer informs us that, during that period, 'he sounded all experiences of life, with all their passions, pleasures, and abandonments;' but in 1862, on the breaking out of the Civil War, he undertook the (gratuitous) service of nursing the wounded. He was a Northerner, of course, but the Southern sick were tended by him with equal care; 'the strongest testimony is borne to his self-devotion and kindliness;' and in a Washington hospital, when attending upon a case of gangrene, he absorbed the poison into his system, and was disabled for six months. In 1865, he obtained a clerkship in the Department of the Interior; but this was taken from him when he published his audacious Leaves of Grass. 'He soon after, however, obtained another modest, but creditable post in the office of the Attorney-general. He still visits the hospitals on Sundays, and often on other days as well.</p><p>The poet is 'much above the average size, and noticeably well-proportioned…. He has light-blue eyes, a florid complexion, a fleecy beard, now gray, and a quite peculiar sort of magnetism about him in relation to those with whom he comes in contact…. He has always been carried by predilection towards the society of the common people; but is not the less for that open to refined and artistic impressions.' As 'an accessible human individual,' he is thus described by a writer in theFortnightly Review: 'Having occasion to visit New York soon after the appearance of Walt Whitman's book, I was urged by some friends to search him out…. The day was excessively hot, the thermometer at nearly 100 , and the sun blazed down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze…. I saw stretched upon his back, and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was seeking. With his gray clothing, his blue-gray shirt, his iron-gray hair, his swart sunburned face and bare neck, he lay upon the brown-and-white grass—for the sun had burned away its greenness—and was so like the earth upon which he rested that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to pass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name and reason for searching him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot. 'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then walked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room. A small room of about fifteen feet square, with a single window looking out on the barren solitudes of the island; a small cot; a washstand, with a little looking-glass hung over it from a tack in the wall; a pine-table, with pen, ink, and paper on it; an old line-engraving, representing Bacchus, hung on the wall—and opposite, a similar one of Silenus: these constituted the visible environments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a single book in the room…. The books he seemed to know and love best were the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare: these he owned, and probably had in his pockets while we were talking. He had two studies where he read: one was the top of an omnibus; and the other a small mass of sand, then entirely uninhabited, far out in the ocean, called Coney Island…. The only distinguished contemporary he had ever met was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn, who had visited him…. He confessed to having no talent for industry, and that his forte was 'loafing and writing poems:' he was poor, but had discovered that he could, on the whole, live magnificently on bread and water…. On no occasion did he laugh, nor indeed did I ever see him smile.'</p><p>If he does not laugh, he is humorous enough in his poems, although, it may be, without being aware of it. Under the head of Wonders—and if he has the bump of Wonder, I am afraid he has not that of Veneration—he thus discourses:</p><p>The great laws take and effuse without argument;<br>I am of the same style, for I am their friend,<br>I love them quits and quits—I do not halt and <br>make salaams.<br>I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, <br>and the reasons of things;<br><em>They are so beautiful, I nudge myself to listen.</em><br>I cannot say to any person what I hear—I cannot <br>say it to myself—it is very wonderful.</p><P>The notion of nudging one's self to listen is capital, but suggests that there may be a tinge of Irish-American in Mr Walt Whitman's otherwise pur sang (as he would term it). Here is something which, while reminding one in its form of Mr Martin Tupper, would, if the idea should be attributed to him, give that respectable gentleman a fit:</p><p>Of detected persons—To me, detected persons are <br>not in any respect worse than undetected per-<br>sons—and are not in any respect worse than <br>I am myself.<br>Of criminals—To me, any judge, or any juror, is <br>equally criminal—and any reputable person also— <br>and the President is also.</p><p>We cannot more fitly conclude our notice of this really remarkable man than by quoting his most characteristic poem. It is from the Leaves of Grass, and is called Burial. It expresses very strikingly in his strange rhythm the thought that has struck most of us who have any egotism. How strange that the world should have wagged on for ages before we came into it, and how still stranger (and more audacious) that it will still continue to wag on, when we have ceased to wag.</p><p>To think of it!<br>To think of time—of all that retrospection!<br>To think of to-day, and the ages continued hence- <br>forward!</p><p>. . . . . . . . .</p><p>To think that the sun rose in the east! that men <br>and women were flexible, real, alive! that <br>everything was alive!<br>To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, <br>nor bear our part!<br>To think that we are now here, and bear our part!<br>Not a day passes—not a minute or second, without <br>an accouchement!<br>Not a day passes—not a minute or second, without <br>a corpse!<br>The dull nights go over, and the dull days also;<br>The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over;<br>The physician, after long putting off, gives the <br>silent and terrible lookfor an answer;<br>The children come hurried and weeping, and the <br>brothers and sisters are sent for;<br>Medicines stand unused on the shelf (the camphor- <br>smell has long pervaded the rooms);<br>The faithful hand of the living does not desert the <br>hand of the dying;<br>The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of <br>the dying;<br>The breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases;<br>The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it;<br>It is palpable as the living are palpable.</p><p>The living look upon the corpse with their eye- <br>sight,<br>But without eyesight lingers a different living, and <br>looks curiously on the corpse.<br>To think that the rivers will flow, and the snow <br>fall, and the fruits ripen, and act upon others <br>as upon us now—yet not act upon us!<br>To think of all these wonders of city and country, <br>and others taking great interest in them—and <br>we taking no interest in them!<br>To think how eager we are in building our houses! <br>To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite <br>indifferent!</p><p>The poet considers the universalness of this thing called Death</p><p>Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole <br>earth…they never cease…they are the burial- <br>lines;<br>He that was President was buried, and he that is <br>now President shall surely be buried.</p><p>But the particular illustration which Walt Whitman characteristically selects of Burial is by no means that of the President, but of an old Broadway stage-driver. It is so graphic, that it might be a sketch by Dickens, and yet it has a weird sort of rhythm about it that separates it from prose of any sort:</p><p>Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf—posh and <br>ice in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets, a <br>gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last <br>day-light of Twelfth-month;<br>A hearse and stages—other vehicles give place— <br>the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, <br>the cortège mostly drivers.</p><p>Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the <br>death-bell, the gate is passed, the new-dug <br>grave is halted at, the living alight, the hearse <br>uncloses,<br>The coffin is passed out, lowered and settled, the <br>whip is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly <br>shovelled in,<br>The mound above is flatted with the spades—silence;<br>A minute, no one moves or speaks—it is done;<br>He is decently put away—is there anything more?</p><p>He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tem- <br>pered, not bad-looking, able to take his own <br>part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with <br>life or death for a friend, fond of women, <br>gambled, ate hearty, drank hearty, had known<br> what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited <br>toward the last, sickened, was helped by a <br>contribution, died, aged forty-one years—and <br>that was his funeral.<br>Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, <br>strap, wet-weather clothes, whip carefully <br>chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody<br> loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, head-<br>way, man before and man behind, good day's <br>work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, <br>first out, last out, turning-in at night;<br>To think that these are so much and so nigh to <br>other drivers—and he there takes no interest <br>in them!</p><p>∗ Poems by Walt Whitman.

	"title": "Poems of Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p><strong> POEMS OF WALT WHITMAN.* </strong></p><p>Some eight or ten years ago there was delivered to the world a volume of what were called poems by a being who called himself in the preface a 'Kosmos,' but who in the flesh—and he was very much in the flesh—was known as Walt Whitman. The Kosmos hailed from America, and was introduced to the reader in a frontispiece which represented an unkempt, dishevelled person in long hair and impossible eyes, crowned with a wide-awake hat. This picturesque ruffian announced himself as 'of the Manahatta, singing thereof, and no less in myself than the whole of Manahatta in itself.' In order to make himself and his mission still clearer to the minds of men, he thus spoke in his preface:—</p><p>'This is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labour to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown, or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the young, and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school, or church, or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem, and have the richest fluency, not only in its words, but in the silent lines of its lips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and in every motion and joint of your body.'</p><p>Unimpressed by these warnings, the critics scoffed at Leaves of Grass. They could not discover that the Kosmos wrote either poetry or sense. They could perceive that he was obscene, filthy, and blasphemous—that he knew his filth and revelled in it—calling upon us to admire in him that which was most nasty—shouting and gibbering like an ill-conditioned chimpanzee. What small gleams of meaning there lay in these simious utterances was the veriest commonplace, the baldest platitude. In fact, the critics declared that this new poet from beyond the seas was but a wild and inflated Tupper, that he was nebulous only because he had no meaning, that even when most distinct he was incoherent, and that altogether it was a very foolish and dull sort of monster.</p><p>Mr. W. M. Rosetti calls upon us now with much gravity to reverse all these judgments. Walt Whitman, we are told, is not a man to be overlooked. Walt Whitman is a true seer, a most subtle and profound poet. Rough he may be, but he is the child of Nature. Wild he may be, but he is the Spirit of the Young World. In Walt Whitman we are called upon to recognise 'the founder of American poetry rightly to be so called, and the most sonorous poetic voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy.' Before Walt Whitman we are called upon to bow, as the genius of the Future, the expounder of the To Be. As for Mr. Rosetti, who, in other respects, is a sensible and decent man, and a delicate and acute critic; he is overwhlemed with the contemplation of this huge, blurred figure of a Titan which rises out of chaos. He prostrates himself before the uncouth image of Whitman, just as a Hindoo grovels before Siva. In the writings of Walt Whitman Mr. Rosetti discovers 'a waif of prose amid the weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare himself furnishes the precedent for in drama.' Evidently Mr. Rosetti is only restrained by a feeling of delicacy towards public opinion from pronouncing Whitman a much greater man than Shakespeare. 'The entire book' (Leaves of Grass) he declares to be 'the poem of the natural man, not of the merely physical, still less of the disjunctively intellectual or spiritual man, but of him who, being a man first and foremost, is therein also a spirit and an intellect.' Certainly, nothing like this could be said of poor William Shakespeare. He was but a small creature, and never wrote anything like 'a poem of the natural man.' Of the disjunctively intellectual, it is probable that an English bard had but the dimmest notion. He was all very well for his time, but he was not a Kosmos. It is probable that he never thought of a 'mission' at all, and we are very sure that he received no hint in his soul of 'the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy.'</p><p>By way of showing us what a superior animal is this American poet, Mr. Rosetti has given us a selection of his works, with which he has taken what we must consider the unwarrantable liberty of cutting out all the blasphemies and obscenities. Surely this is but scurvy treatment for the poet of the Future. Surely the pæan of the natural man' ought to be given to us entire, as the prophet himself delivered it. What right has Mr. Rosetti to blurt and spoil the great message which is intended for our salvation? The excuse that an editor gives for leaving out about one-half of what Walt Whitman really wrote, and for dressing up the remainder with headings and cutting it into arbitrary lengths, we must hold to be very insufficient. Mr. Rosetti tells us that he has omitted 'every poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age'—which is but a clumsy way of serving either the poet or the age. Surely a Kosmos knows better than Mr. Rosetti what is best for the age. The pæan of the natural man, to be of any value, should be given in the singer's own words. How are we to judge of whole man Whitman if we are to see only the most decent part of him? Those who are acquainted with Leaves of Grass in their original form know that it is this very indecency and bold out-speaking upon which Walt Whitman prides himself—which are his claims to the Kosmical distinction. We presume it is not by school-girls that Whitman's place in literature is to be fixed. Why then this foolish and insulting squeamishness?</p><p>How the purged and shaved Whitman looks under Mr. Rosetti's hands we can best show by specimens of his poetry. Here is one passage, which we are led to believe is a favourable sample of our poet's quality, which may be supposed to be valuable as explaining the 'tangibilities of the prospective democracy':—</p><p>'Democracy!<br>Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing.<br>Ma femme!<br>For the brood beyond us and of us,<br>For those who belong here, and those to come,<br>I, exultant, to be ready for them will now shake out carols stronger and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon the earth,<br>I will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,<br>And your songs, outlawed offenders—for I scan you with kindred eyes, and carry you with me the same as any.<br>I will make the true poem of riches,—<br>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and is not dropped by death.<br>I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all—and I will be the bard of personality;<br>And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other;<br>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present—and can be none in the future;<br>And I will show that, whatever happens to anybody, it may be turned to beautiful results—and I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death;<br>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact,<br>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound as any.<br>I will not make poems with reference to parts;<br>But I will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts, with reference to ensemble;<br>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days;<br>And I will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference to the soul;<br>Because, having looked at the objects of the universe, I hold there is no one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the soul.'</p><p>To those who may still hold that the tangibilities of democracy are a little hazy we can give no consolation. If they will not believe Mr. Rosetti they will not believe Walt Whitman, who sent him. The poetry of the future may be considered to be slightly wanting both in rhythm and reason; but those who make this objection are vulgar persons to whom the vision has never come. They are only to be pitied and passed by—according to Mr. Rosetti. To the enlightened few it will be only necessary to quote such a passage as this, and all is clear:—</p><p><em>'WHEREFORE?</em><br>O me! O life! . . . of the questions of those recurring;<br>Of the endless trains of the faithless—of cities filled with the foolish;<br>Of myself for ever reproaching myself (for who more foolish than I and who more faithless?);<br>Of eyes that vainly crave the light—of the objects mean—of the struggle ever renewed;<br>Of the poor results of all—of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me;<br>Of the empty and useless years of the rest—with the rest me intertwined;<br>The question, O me! so sad, recurring,—What good amid these, O me, O life?'</p><p><em>'ANSWER.</em><br>'That you are here—that life exists, and identity;<br>That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.'<br>And part of another poem is as follows:—<br>'The workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth;<br>The great masters know the earth's words, and use them more than the audible words,<br>Amelioration is one of the earth's words;<br>The earth neither lags nor hastens;<br>It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump;<br>It is not half beautiful only—defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show,<br>The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough;<br>The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so concealed either;<br>They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;<br>They are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,<br>Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth. I utter and utter:<br>I speak not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail am I to you?<br>To bear—to better; lacking these, of what avail am I?<br>Accouche! Accouchez!<br>Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?<br>Will you squat and stifle there?<br>The earth does not argue,<br>Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,<br>Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,<br>Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,<br>Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,<br>Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.<br>The earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itself—posesses still underneath;<br>Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves,<br>Persuasions of lovers, curses, gaps of the dying, laughter of young people, accents of bargainers,<br>Underneath these, possessing the words that never fail.<br>To her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail;<br>The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does not fail;<br>Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail.'</p><p>According to one of Walt Whitman's admirers, this is one of those portions of the work by which we perceive that 'life is everything, that man is an integral part of the world's life, and that it is by the full unfolding of man's powers that life is ennobled and the world made beautiful.' After this, may we not put in a claim for our own Tupper? Has he not written to show that 'life is everything,' and that 'man is an integral part of the world's life?' What is the burden of our latter-day Solomon, if not that it is by the full unfolding of a man's powers that life is to be ennobled? It is true that our Tupper does not violate the decencies, nor call himself a Kosmos. But surely it is but a dissolute and an inebriate Tupper who writes most of the lines which Mr. Rosetti so admires. What shall we say to this, for instance:—</p><p>'All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;<br>Did you think it was in the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches and cornices?<br>All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments.'</p><p>Or in a higher key and in the most prophetic manner this, which really contains the only gem of a poetic idea which to our common understandings is perceptible in Walt Whitman:—</p><p>'What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the seas?<br>Are all nations communing? Is there going to be but one heart to the globe?<br>Is humanity forming en masse?—for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim;<br>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war;<br>No one knows what will happen next—such portents fill the days and nights;<br>Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full of phantoms;<br>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;<br>This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams, O years!<br>Your dreams, O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I sleep or wake!)<br>The performed American and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me;<br>The unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.'</p><p>We are entreated to give this kind of thing a patient hearing, and are asked to recognise it as at least a real voice arising out of the motion of the universe. It may be that Walt Whitman is a true poet and that to him is given the key which is to unlock the secret of the future. If so, we can only say that the world has been all wrong as to what constitutes poetry. If Walt Whitman is a poet, then we have greatly to enlarge the circle of Parnassus, and to make easy the way to the summit. If to discharge one's imagination of all the crude shapes which gather there be to write poetry, then there are some thousands who have only to print what comes apparent to their mind to earn the title of seer. Let it be cut into lengths, with a capital letter at the beginning of each length, and lo! it is a poem. Neither rhyme nor reason is required, and very little decency. One has but to secure an editor like Mr. W. M. Rosetti, and the world is made acquainted with a new poet.</p><p>In the present instance it will require more than Mr. Rosetti's authority, we fear, to make Walt Whitman an acceptable poet to the multitude. However familiar with the future, he is likely to remain a sealed book to the present. This cannot be, of course, any disadvantage to a Kosmos—a Manahatta—a professor of the Tangibilities of Democracy—a singer of the pæan of natural life. Being all these things, Walt Whitman can afford to wait, and it is highly probable that to wait will be his only alternative.</p><p>———</p><p>*'Poems by Walt Whitman.' Selected and edited by W. M.

	"title": "The Poetry of the Period",
	"body": "<p><strong>The Poetry of the Period</p><p>———</p><p>THE POETRY OF THE FUTURE</strong></p><p>MANY people will, we daresay, be surprised to find that we have not yet exhausted the Poetry of the Period, and still more astonished at our placing in that category the 'Poetry of the Future.' But have they not heard of the 'Music of the Future;' and not only heard of it, but heard it? It is not a thing promised, but a thing accomplished. The foundations of it at least are laid; and even these are pronounced by its prophets to be already superior to the highest summits ever attained by such puny composers of the past as Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven. So is it with the Poetry of the Future. It consists of no merely prophesied strains: the first singer of it is here and amongst us, and his previous productions are to be had at the circulating libraries. True, he is only the first of a long succession of coming bards; but these will follow in his footsteps, as Virgil is said to have trodden in those of Homer, Dante in those of Virgil, Milton in those of Dante, and so on through the sustained inheritance of song. If, as has been seen, we are not overwell satisfied with such productions of the muse as are vouchsafed us by living English bards, we have no reason to distress ourselves, or even to cast fond eyes upon the bygone days of a happier poetical literature, in order to find consolation. We must look forwards, not backwards. Not Byron and his predecessors, but Mr. Walt Whitman and his successors, constitute the balm that still abides in Gilead. The Old World is done up, no doubt; but Apollo has taken refuge in the United States. The pottering little fountain of Hippocrene, now run dry, has been replaced by the tremendous waters of the everlasting Mississippi, and the Parnassian and Heliconian ranges have abdicated in favour of the Alleghanies and the setting sun.</p><p>That our readers may not think we are setting up imaginary claims, we must beg to be permitted to lay before them the proofs of their existence; and we have less scruple in doing so, as we fancy we have in store for them no mean entertainment. To some of them the name of Mr. Walt Whitman will be faintly familiar; but to others, and indeed the majority, we imagine it will represent nothing at all. It is highly desirable that they should become more intimately acquainted with a gentleman who, both through his own voice, and (as we shall shortly see) through the voices of some exceedingly well-known English admirers, affects to be doing so much for the present and future literary greatness of the human race.</p><p>Mr. Walt Whitman was incited to compose the various poems, from which we will make copious citations as we proceed, by a contempt for the Poetry of the Period; and it is obvious that he, therefore, has a special claim upon our attention. His opinion of it is, that it is either 'the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, or more or less musical verbiage, arising out of a life of depression and enervation as their result; or else that class of poetry, plays, &c., of which the foundation is feudalism, with its ideas of lords and ladies, its standard of gentility, and the manners of high life below stairs in every line and verse.' From him we are to expect no such feminine and frivolous stuff; he is as masculine—again another reason for our examining his pretensions—as any of us, sick of the feminine twang of other lyres, can possibly desire:—</p><p>'No dainty dolcè affetuoso I;<br>Branded, sunburnt, grey-necked, forbidding, I have arrived,<br>To be wrestled with as I pass, for the solid prizes of the universe.'</p><p>He is declared by one of his most ardent admirers, Mr. W.M. Rossetti—to whom we shall have to revert more than once in this paper, and who is esteemed, by a select but somewhat notorious circle, a mighty authority in poetical matters—to 'occupy at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past times, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction, that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one-a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America. He believes that the Columbus of the Continent, or the Washington of the States, was not more truly than himself the patron and founder and upbuilder of this America.'</p><p>That this is no exaggerated account of Mr. Walt Whitman's estimate of himself is apparent on almost every page of his writings, for on page after page it is distinctly laid down:—</p><p>'See, projected through time,<br>For me an audience interminable.<br>Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions;<br>With faces turned sideways or backward towards me, to listen.<br>With eyes retrospective towards Me.'</p><p>'Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian;<br>Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!<br>For you a programme of chants!'</p><p>'In the year 80 of the States,<br>My tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from this soil, this air,<br>Born here of parents born here, form parents the same, and their <br>parents the same,<br>I, now thirty-six old, in perfect health begin.<br>Hoping to cease not till death.'</p><p>At another time he exclaims:—</p><p>'For your life, adhere to me;<br>Of all men of the earth, I only can unloose you and toughen you.<br>None have understood you, but I understand you.<br>I have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all.<br>Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens.'</p><p>It is very likely to be objected, that though, perhaps, no such wonderful phenomenon has previously been witnessed as a person believing that within him has taken place so supernatural an operation as the one intimated in the above concluding line, yet the world has seen a goodly number of individuals who proclaimed themselves to be the coming man; and that the estimate formed by Mr. Walt Whitman of himself, is no test of the estimate other people form of him. Let us then come to that; for, after all, that is the most wonderful as it is the most important part of the affair. And, to begin with, let us see what is thought of this poetical avatar by Mr. Rossetti; cramming (for brevity's sake) into one paragraph the diffuse eulogies which this gentleman has passed upon him:—</p><p>Mr. Whitman's poem, he says, 'is, par excellence, the modern poem. . . . It forms incomparably the largest performance of our period in poetry. . . . He breaks with all precedent. . . . His work is practically certain to stand as archetypal for many future poetic efforts. The entire book may be called the pæan of the natural man. . . . This most remarkable poet is the founder of American poetry, rightly to be called, and the most sonorous poetic voice of the tangibilities of actual and prospective democracy. . . . If any thing can cast, in the eyes of posterity, an added halo of brightness round the unsullied personal qualities and the great doings of Lincoln, it will assuredly be the written monument reared to him by Whitman. I sincerely believe him to be of the order of great poets, and by no means of pretty good ones. . . . I believe that Whitman is one of the huge, as yet unrecognized, forces of our time-privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by generation after generation of believing and ardent disciples. . . . Poets, said Shelley, are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind. Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out for legislation of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken—that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>We think that, after these samples of Mr. Rossetti's opinion as to Mr. Walt Whitman, it will be confessed we have not begun by exaggerating his pretensions as acknowledged in certain quarters. Mr. Rossetti has given utterance to his views in the columns of highly influential critical journals; and his views plainly are, that Mr. Whitman is the Homer of the New World, and that his 'Leaves of Grass' and 'Drum Taps' will be regarded by 'Americanos' to come with the same love and veneration with which European men of letters regard the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p><p>Another of the admirers of this 'unacknowledged legislator' is Mr. Robert Buchanan, himself by profession both a poet and a critic. Mr. Buchanan's opinions on the subject are embodied in a paper published some little time back in the Broadway ; and though he does not like to talk of his author as an artist, and sees plainly enough that he is obviously deficient in certain qualities which have hitherto been deemed indispensable in a poet, he has formed an estimate not much less flattering than Mr. Rossetti's. We will apply to it the same method of compression which we have already employed in the case of the latter:—</p><p>'Walt Whitman,' writes Mr. Buchanan, 'is already exercising on the youth of America an influence similar to that exercised by Socrates over the youth of Greece, or by Raleigh over the young chivalry of England. In a word, he has become a sacer vates —his ministry is admitted by palpable live disciples. . . . We are in concert with those who believe his to be a genuine ministry, large in its spiritual manifestations, and abundant in capabilities for good. . . . He professes to sow the first seeds of an indigenous literature, by putting in the music the spiritual and fleshly yearnings of the cosmical man. . . . He sees in the American future the grandest realisation of centuries of idealism. . . . Thoughts crowd so thick upon him that he has no time to seek their artistic equivalent;* he utters his thoughts in any way, and his expressions gain accidental beauty from the glamour of his sympathy. . . . He is inspired. . . . In actual living force, in grip and muscle, he has no equal among contemporaries. . . . He is the voice of which America stood most in need. . . . He is the clear forerunner of the great American poet, long longed for, often prophesied.'</p><p>This, in substance, is Mr. Buchanan's conclusion. But Mr. Rossetti, besides favouring us with his own opinion on the subject, is good enough to inform us of various other critical authorities who are pretty much of his way of thinking. Amongst these he names Mr. William Bell Scott, a name perhaps not very familiar to most of our readers, but which Mr. Rossetti answers for as belonging to 'a true poet and a strong thinker'; and Mr. Scott, he says, considers that the value of Mr. Whitman's poetry is real and great. The name of Mr. Swinburne, however, is known far and wide; and Mr. Rossetti informs us that 'he also is an admirer of Whitman.' Of English newspapers which have paid him a proper tribute, he mentions the Dispatch, the Leader, the London Review, and the Pall Mall Gazette. We have not seen the notices referred to, but we are quite willing to take Mr. Rossetti's word for it that the journals in question have shown themselves 'discerning' in the matter. What meaning Mr. Rossetti attaches to 'discernment,' in estimating Mr. Whitman's literary merits and position-unless, indeed, he would allow that his own estimate is very undiscerning-we have already seen; and though we may be surprised to hear that a journal so little disposed to deal in extravagances on its own account, or to welcome them in others, as the Pall Mall Gazette, has been 'discerning' towards Mr. Walt Whitman in Mr. Rossetti's sense, we suppose it is so. After naming various other literary authorities, who, he says, 'express themselves with no measured enthusiasm,' and referring to an anonymous critic, 'highly entitled to form an opinion on any poetic question, whose admiration and enjoyment of Whitman's greatness grow keener and warmer every time he thinks of him,' Mr. Rossetti crowns his array of flattering testimonies by appealing to Mr. Emerson. The opinion of the latter gentleman is that ' 'Leaves of Grass' is the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.'</p><p>So much for what are called critical opinions. Some people, however, opine that the proof of a poem is in the selling; but here, again, Mr. Walt Whitman's admirers may fairly claim to be able to produce satisfactory evidence. The first edition of 'Leaves of Grass,' consisting of about a thousand copies, was sold off in less than a year. A second edition excited, we are told, 'a considerable storm,' and a further edition, now of between four and five thousand copies, followed. Other editions have since been issued.</p><p>It is perfectly clear, therefore, that, whether we appeal to the judgment of individuals supposed to be possessed of due literary qualifications, or to the great American public, we must accept it as a fact that we are pressingly invited to recognize Mr. Walt Whitman as 'the founder of American poetry,' rightly to be called, 'as one of the order of great poets,' as 'one of the huge forces of our time,' as an 'unacknowledged legislator,' as a voice 'potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken,' as 'the announcer and inspirer of the uttermost avatars of democracy'—in a word, as the founder of the Poetry of the Future.</p><p>Such being the case, let us boldly look this bold man in the face, and see what he is like; for if he really be not only of the order of great poets, but the founder of an absolutely new school of poetry, evidently he is a pearl beyond all price. His fundamental notions of poetry are, we must confess, for the most part correct. 'The direct trial of him,' he says in his preface to 'Leaves of Grass,' 'who would be the greatest poet, is to-day. As if it were necessary to trot back generation after generation to the Eastern records!' We have ourselves so strongly insisted on this point, that we need scarcely say we cordially agree with the sentiments thus expressed. The trial of the great poet is undoubtedly to-day. We, however, have asserted in no doubtful terms that the trial is too great, and that to-day has produced and can produce no great poet. Mr. Whitman says it can and has, and he is the great poet it has produced. The present age has broken with the past, and he has done the same; and he is the great poet of to-day, and the founder of the great Poetry of the Future.</p><p>'See, projected through time,<br>For me an audience interminable.</p><p>'Whoever you are! to you endless announcements.'</p><p>'Daughter of the lands, did you wait for your poets?<br>Did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand?'</p><p>'Toward the male of the States, and toward the female of the States,<br>Give words—words to the lands.'</p><p>'Still the present I raise aloft—still the future of the States I harbinge, <br>glad and sublime.'</p><p>Mr. Whitman then sings of to-day, and does so of set purpose—a purpose with which we should heartily sympathise if we did not feel the profound conviction that doing so is only lost time. The next question is, What does he see in to-day to sing? He sees four things: namely, America, Democracy, Personality, and Materialism. These for him are the subjects of song both in the present and the future; and he would be a bold man who would deny that, if to-day be the trial of a great poet, these four things may, if not must, properly constitute the great poet's themes. Let us see what he has to say concerning each of them in succession.</p><p>The references to America—its greatness, bigness, wonderfulness—in Mr. Whitman's 'Poems' are incessant; and certainly the glory of one's country has ever been deemed a worthy subject for the muse:</p><p>'Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,<br>For you a programme of chants.<br>Chants of the prairies;<br>Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican <br>sea;'<br>'Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota;<br>Chants going forth from the centre, from Kansas, and thence equi-<br>distant,<br>Shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all.'</p><p>'Take my leaves, America! take them South, and take them North!<br>Surround them, East and West! for they would surround you.'</p><p>'I will report all heroism from an American point of view.'</p><br><p>'America always!<br>Always our own feuillage.<br>Always Florida's green peninsula! Always the priceless delta of <br>Louisiana! Always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas!<br>Always,' &c.</p><p>And so on, through pages of what Mr. Rossetti calls 'the first order of poetry.' We need scarcely load our pages with quotations from well-known poets on the subject of their country; we think we may rest content to say that, if the foregoing be poetry at all, all that Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan have written about Rome—all that Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, and Alfieri have written about Italy—all that Scott and Burns have written about Scotland—had better be flung into the dusthole and forgotten. In his preface to 'Leaves of Grass,' Mr. Whitman informs us that 'the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem;' and farther on, in the same production, he declares that 'of all nations, the United States, with veins full of poetical stuff, will doubtless have the greatest poets'—he himself being, as we have seen, the forerunner and first of them. All this, as anybody can perceive who possesses an atom of penetration, arises simply from Mr. Whitman's admiration of bigness—which he mistakes for greatness—attempting to carry it on his shoulders, and staggering under it most woefully. In fact, all the quotations we have as yet made from his 'poems'—and we have so far quoted only the most rational of them—will, we fancy, strike our readers as resembling more what they will imagine must have been the improvising of savages in their literary moods before (if we may be pardoned the bull) letters were known at all.</p><p>'O Camerado close!<br>O you and me at last—and us two only!<br>O a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly!<br><em>O something ecstatic and indemonstrable! O music wild!'</em></p><p>'All these States compact—every square mile of these States without <br>excepting a particle.<br>O land! O all so dear to me—what you are (wherever it is). I become a <br>part of that, whatever it is!<br>Southward, then, I go screaming, with wings slowly flapping, with the <br>myriad of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida.'</p><p>We confess we think the picture not an inaccurate one. Mr. Walt Whitman screaming, and with wings slowly flapping, realises our notion of him in his poetical condition—this Gull of Mississippi, as opposed to the Swan of Avon—as perfectly as language could well present it to us.</p><p>In connection with this wild inarticulate worship of America must be noticed Mr. Whitman's attempts at what may be called Universality. It is one of the tricks of our time, and, as a matter of course, he is infected with it. Unable, just like many of his somewhat less boisterous contemporaries, to understand the vast problem presented by the past, present, and future of the world, like them again he fancies he has solved it by a clumsy application of the Bene quodcunque est doctrine. Here is his way of expressing himself on the subject:</p><p>'I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;<br>I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demigod;<br>I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true without excep-<br>tion.<br>I assert that all past days were what they should have been.<br>And that they could nohow have been better than they were;<br>And that to-day is what it should be, and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could nohow be better than they are.'</p><p>It is just possible that some people will find this assuring; but we should vastly like to see the person who thinks it poetry, let alone 'the highest order of poetry.' In one of his 'poems,' called 'Salut Au Monde,' he gets hold of the atlas, enumerates nearly every spot on the face of the globe, and says that he sees, hears, and belongs to it. It is done in this fashion:</p><p>'I see the cities of the earth, and make myself at random a part of <br>them;<br>I am a real Parisian;<br>I am a habitant of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople;<br>I am of Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne;<br>I am of London, Manchester, Bristol, Edinburgh, Limerick;<br>I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brussels, Berne, <br>Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, and Florence.'</p><p>And so on, varied by 'I see,' 'I hear,' 'I behold.' But he goes still farther than this. His 'Universality' embraces not only all places, but all persons, and everything they can do, good, bad, or indifferent:</p><p>'Good or bad, I never question—I love all—I do not condemn any-<br>thing;<br>To me detected persons are not, in any respect, worse than undetected <br>persons—and are not in any respect worse than I am myself.<br>To me any judge, or any juror, is equally criminal with criminals—and <br>any reputable person is also—and the President is also.'</p><p>'Omnes! Omnes! let others ignore what they may;<br>I make the poem of evil also—I commemorate that part also;<br>I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is—<br>And I say there is in fact no evil;<br>Or, if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to <br>me, as anything else.'</p><p>There is much more to the same effect which we cannot possibly quote; but when we add that he avers ugliness to be as welcome to him as beauty, and declares, on one occasion, 'I will sleep with the cleaners of ——' (there is no blank in the original), a fair notion of Mr. Whitman's poetical universality—springing from and invariably returning to the central notion that everything either is America or has been made for it—has been obtained by the reader.</p><p>America thus being the very stock-in-trade of his compositions, democracy, as a matter of course, comes in for considerable glorification, after the author's tumultuous fashion:</p><p>'Democracy!<br>Near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully <br>singing!<br>Ma femme!<br>For the brood beyond us and of us!<br>For those who belong here, and those to come.<br>I exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger <br>and haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth.'</p><p>A story is told of a countryman of Mr. Walt Whitman, who, after reading Mr. Tennyson's 'In Memoriam,' passed on it the not inapt criticism, 'What on airth is the use of screaming against the calm facts of creation?' Mr. Whitman evidently thinks that at any rate, there is a good deal of use in screaming for them. He wishes to see democracy screaming too:</p><p>'Thunder on! stride on. Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!<br>And do you rise higher than ever yet, O days, O cities!<br>Crash heavier, heavier yet, O storms! you have done me good.'</p><p>Borne almost beyond himself, he in one place exclaims:</p><p>'Bully for you! you proud, friendly, free Manhattanese!'</p><p>But, of course, all Americans are equally proud, friendly, and free, and every one of them is just as proud, friendly, free, and everything else, as every other:</p><p>'The wife—and she is not one jot less than the husband<br>The daughter—and she is just as good as the son;<br>The mother—and she is every bit as much as the father.'</p><p>One more quotation, and we will leave this second theme of Mr. Walt Whitman's:</p><p>'I sing the Equalities.<br>I sing the Finale of things.<br>I announce natural persons to arise.<br>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality.<br>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics <br>of the earth insignificant.'</p><p>His glorification of the individual, or Personality, as he himself loves to call it, is nearly as frequent, and to the full as conspicuous. He never alludes to subordination or co-ordination; he knows them not. The doctrine of Pope, that:</p><p>'Order is Heaven's first law; and, that confessed,<br>Some are and must be better than the rest;'</p><p>or that of Shakespeare:</p><p>'Take but degree away, untune that string,<br>And mark what discord follows'—</p><p>are unknown to him; or, if they are known, he utterly contemns them. As he says, he sings the Equalities, with a large E.</p><p>'I will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all-and I will be the <br>bard of personality.'</p><p>Sometimes he glorifies it in himself, sometimes in another, sometimes in himself and another together:</p><p>'Rest not, till you rivet and publish yourself of your own Personality.<br>Go, mon cher! if need be, and inure yourself to self-esteem—ele-<br>vatedness.'</p><p>'I celebrate myself.<br>And what I assume you shall assume.<br>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs to you.'</p><p>'O my comrade!<br>O you and me at last, and us two only!<br>O to level occupations and the sexes! O to bring all to common <br>ground! O adhesiveness!<br>O the pensive aching to be together—you know not why, and I know <br>not why.'</p><p>'Who need be afraid of the merge?<br>Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded;<br>I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no.'</p><p>'Me imperturbe,<br>Me standing at ease in Nature.<br>Master of all—aplomb in the midst of irrational things.<br>Me private or public (I am eternally equal with the best—I am not <br>subordinate).'</p><p>And, as a matter of course, You doing the same thing, and occupying the same proud position!</p><p>We now arrive at the fourth of the main themes whose glories Mr. Walt Whitman and his admirers consider that he is specially commissioned to sing, or (as he himself expresses it) to 'yawp over the roofs of the world.' We mean—Materialism. We are informed, by one of the many curiositymongers who have busied themselves with Mr. Whitman's private habits—with which we have nothing to do—that he is exceedingly communicative on all subjects save one. If interrogated as to his theological opinions, he turns dead silent. In his compositions, however, he is garrulous enough upon the subject, and, some will think, rather contradictory. We are not of that opinion. It is true he speaks continually of the Soul; but then there is, we should imagine, no word in the language capable of a vague signification, and of being commenced with a capital, that does not find its way into his tumultuous tossing together of the component parts of the dictionary. How far he understands the Soul in any recognized acceptation of the word, our readers will judge for themselves, when they have seen a few of his utterances on the subject:</p><p>'Was somebody asking to see the Soul?<br>See! your own shape and countenance-persons, substances, beasts, <br>the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands!<br>How can the real body ever die and be buried?<br>Behold! the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern— <br>and includes and is the soul.<br>Whoever you are! how superb and how divine is your body, or any <br>part of it!'</p><p>With him this is a rooted conviction. He says that he is 'divine inside and out,' and with a license of language—which is a mere nothing to what he often indulges in, but which in this instance makes us lose our sense of profanity in an irresistible peal of laughter—he assures us that 'the scent of these armpits is an aroma finer than prayer!' If he worships any particular thing, he says it shall be 'some of the spread of my own body.' One long passage commences thus:</p><p>'O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in either men or women, <br>nor the likes of the parts of you;<br>I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the Soul <br>(and that they are the Soul).<br>Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,<br>Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,<br>Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck slue,<br>Upper arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones,<br>Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone,<br>The thin red jellies within you, or with me—<br>O, I say now, these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but <br>of the Soul!<br>O, I say these are the Soul!'</p><p>It must not be supposed we have quoted the entire passage. We dare not, even if we had space. Suffice it to say that the enumeration covers two long pages, and that, physiologically speaking, it is exhaustive. Nor is his admiration confined to the human body:</p><p>'Beef in the butcher's stall, the area of pens of live pork, the killing- <br>hammer, the hog-hook, the scalder's tub, gutting, the gutter's <br>cleaver, the packer's maul, and the plenteous winter-work of pork- <br>packing.<br>In them poems for you and me.<br>I say that none lead to greater than those lead to.'</p><p>As a concluding and crowning embodiment and expression of Mr. Whitman's Materialism, let us take the following:—</p><p>'I will make the poems of materials, for I think these are to be the <br>most spiritual poems.<br>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,<br>For I shall then supply myself with the poems of the Soul, and of <br>immortality.<br>Strange and hard that paradox true I give;<br>Objects gross and the unseen Soul are one.'</p><p>We trust that no one has supposed that, in giving extracts from Mr. Walt Whitman's 'poems,' as far as they relate to America, Democracy, Personality, and Materialism, we have been intending to turn his opinions into ridicule, or even to quarrel with him in the least for holding them. We need scarcely say that his opinions are not ours, but neither are those of Mr. Swinburne or Doctor Newman; yet we believe it will be allowed that we attempted to cast no slur on the opinions of either of those writers. That is not the function of the purely literary critic. Mr. Whitman is as heartily welcome to his views of the Universe, as far as we are concerned, as anybody else is: and if we have brought them into prominence, it is only because we thought that our account of him would thus be made both more entertaining and more complete; whilst at the same time we should be compelled to make quotations from him with obvious impartiality, and the reader would obtain just as fair an idea of his literary merits as if we had proceeded in a less methodical fashion.</p><p>Mr. Whitman's opinions, therefore, be his own, without any controversy from us! But we do not think we should be doing our duty, either to ourselves or the true interests of literature, if we did not inform our readers, who may possibly have been just a little offended by certain of the passages we have cited, that his 'poems' swarm with pages upon pages of whose horrible and ineffable nastiness they cannot possibly form any conception. Mr. Rossetti—who is the editor of the English edition, and who has omitted from it the parts to which we chiefly refer—considers that most of them would be better away, and doubts whether even one of them, deserves to be retained in the exact phraseology it at present exhibits. We wish Mr. Rossetti had contented himself with this avowal, quite insufficient under the circumstances as we think it. Unfortunately, he has blanced this mild reprobation by the averment, in another place, that he has excluded the 'poems' to which we refer, out of deference to 'the propriety of the peculiarly nervous age,' and that he 'sacrifices them grudgingly.' We think we have shown ourselves not particularly squeamish; but if we were to print the very least offensive of the passages alluded to—though they circulate freely in America—the days of this magazine would very justly be numbered.</p><p>Anybody who considers the matter will see that this has a direct bearing on the purely literary side of the question. Mr. Whitman over and over again protests that he has no shame. As Mr. Buchanan—mildly even—puts it for him, 'He sees that the beasts are not ashamed; why, therefore, should he be ashamed?' here we have it. He recognizes no shame, no law, no forms, no good, no evil, no beauty, no ugliness, no distinctions, differences, or limitations. This, of course, will account for the disconnectedness of his utterances, and the utter disorder of his language. We suspect that many of our readers will here be inclined to say, what doubtless they have long been thinking—'What is the use of proving the self-evident, that all which Mr. Walt Whitman writes is stark staring nonsense, both in substance and in form equally?' We can fully sympathise with the impatience which prompts such an interruption; but whilst doing so, we would ask them to turn once again to the encomiums passed by others upon these productions, which we cited at starting in order to protect ourselves against the notion that we were wasting our powder. With regard to the form of Mr. Whitman's compositions, we would ask them to attend for a moment to what Mr. Rossetti and Mr. Buchanan, let alone others equally pretending to authority, have to say on this particular point.</p><p>'Whitman's poems,' writes the former, 'present no trace of rhyme save in a couple or so of chance instances. Parts of them, indeed, may be regarded as a warp of prose amid the weft of poetry, such as Shakespeare furnishes the precedent for in drama. Still there is a very powerful and majestic rhythmical sense throughout.'</p><p>Mr. Buchanan, as we have seen, writes with much more moderation than Mr. Rossetti; but even he asserts that Mr. Whitman's language is 'strong, vehement, always forcible, and sometimes even rhythmical, like the prose of Plato;' that his lines are 'lines of unrhymed verse, very Biblical in form, and showing indeed on every page the traces of Biblical influence;' and that he has 'risen on the States to point the way to new literatures.'</p><p>Such, then, being the opinions which, it must be presumed, some people in these strange days entertain, since they express them, of Mr. Walt Whitman's literary claims, we think it right, if only to liberate our souls—and we should imagine those of most of our readers—emphatically, but in all serious calmness, to declare, on the contrary, our opinion, that his style has nothing in common with either the Bible, Shakspeare, Plato, or any other hitherto honoured name in literature; but that his grotesque, ungrammatical, and repulsive rhapsodies can be fitly compared only to the painful ravings of maniacs' dens.</p><p>Such, however, is the Poetry of the Future? Perhaps it is. If so, we must console ourselves by reflecting that, unsatisfactory as may be the Poetry of the Period, if we had been born a generation later still, our poetical plight would have been yet worse than it is. Yet we shrewdly suspect that one is the child of the other. Mr. Whitman himself distinctly says that it is. As we have already stated, he informs us that he was urged to lay the foundations of the Poetry of the Future, because, in his opinion, that of the Period is 'the poetry of an elegantly weak sentimentalism, at bottom nothing but maudlin puerilities, or more or less musical verbiage'—in a word, because, as we ourselves have been urging in those papers, it is deficient in all masculine and lofty qualities. Mr. Whitman revolts against it; and his is a revolt with a vengeance. Mr. Tennyson and his admirers have been fancying that they had swept and garnished the Halls of Literature, got rid of all such objectionable robustness as figures in the verse of Shakespeare, a Byron, or a Burns, and made the place sweet, trim, and pretty for all time. But, alas! seven devils worse than the first have entered, and its state promises to be more terrible than ever. Nor are we sure that there is not a good deal of truth in what Mr. Whitman says of the same school of poetry being based on a now extinct feudalism, and on standards of gentility belonging to a somewhat later period. At any rate, he will have none of these. As Mr. Rossetti reminds us, it has been said of Mr. Whitman by one of his warmest admirers, 'He is Democracy.' We really think he is—in his compositions, at least; being, like it, ignorant, sanguine, noisy, coarse, and chaotic! Democracy may be, and we fear is, our proximate future; and it will, as a matter of course, bring its poetry along with it. The prospect is not an agreeable one; but, as a protection both against it and our present condition, we can always fall back upon the grand old masters of the Past, from whom it is quite certain that singers, whether insipid or insane, will never succeed in weaning the healthy opinion of mankind.</p><p>———</p><p>*As if poetical thoughts did not always bring their artistic equivalent with them!-the thought and the form, or expression, being one. Mr. Buchanan is evidently just as much at sea as are most of his contemporaries as to the genesis of poetry, and just as little aware that poetry, like the poet, is born, not made. Does he suppose Shakspeare went 'seeking' for 'artistic equivalents'?</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman, The American Poet of Democracy",
	"body": "<p><strong>NOTES OF A READER.</p><p>———</p><p>WALT WHITMAN, THE AMERICAN POET OF DEMOCRACY.</strong></p><p>A LITTLE over six months ago we came across an edition of the Works of Walt Whitman, selected and edited by William Michael Rosetti, an Englishman of no mean literary fame, and who possesses the critical faculty in a high degree. Up to the time mentioned, the facts that a new poet had arisen in America, and that much difference of opinion existed as to his merits, were of no special interest.</p><p>Every author has, at one period or another, met with the cross of harsh, undeserved criticism. And with many, such injustice is prejudicial to the acquisition of fame. With Walt Whitman the case is different. He has a self-imposed task to perform; he is to furnish the great 'psalm of the Republic,' the poem of Personality—Personality as it exists in America; and, wrapped in 'sublime egotism'—the egotism of a man who feels himself a king upon earth, not 'wearing the purple,' but in the humble guise of a working man, one whose genius</p><p>'Knows no end,<br>And will to countless years extend<br>Undimm'd, unstained, in glow;'</p><p>he has gone through with his work. The vastness of the territory of America, the grandeur of her natural scenery, the magnitude of her undertaking, and the greatness of her democratic institutions—are themes that, up to the present time, have needed a poet who can enter into the true spirit of the American nation, and think and speak in a way to illustrate such spirit.</p><p>Old world poets, fettered by rules, chained down to precedents, fearing the critic's scourge, thinking less of the affection of the 'common people' than of the admiration of literary circles, have not attained the high level of this new world theme. The tendency of English and American poetry has been hitherto chastening and refining; the Titanic vigour, energy, and intensity of Whitman, seem like the growth of an American forest tree beside a lovely English garden plant; each in its kind is beautiful, but the soul is far more deeply stirred by the former.</p><p>In order fully to understand the character of Walt Whitman's writings, the reader should first be made acquainted with the man and his history. Biography affords valuable aid to the student seeking to fathom the depths of poetry. The outward life of a man is often the key to the inner—the working of the mind. In Whitman this is noticeable. He was born at the farm village of West Hills, Long Island, in the Manhattan state, 'well begotten and raised of a perfect mother,' on the 31st of May, 1819. His family, of English origin, had been settled in the locality for five generations. Walt was one of a large family. The father, Walter Whitman, after whom he was christened, was a farmer, and afterwards a carpenter and builder, adhering in religion to the great quaker iconoclast, Elias Hicks. Walt was schooled at Brooklyn, and began life in a printing office, at the age of thirteen, subsequently turning his attention to teaching, and later still becoming a 'miscellaneous press-writer' in New York. In 1849 he began to travel, and became newspaper editor at New Orleans, and afterwards a printer at Brooklyn, the place of his schooldays. With that versatile genius which enables Americans of every class to adapt themselves to circumstances, and follow every pursuit, he next followed his father's business of carpentry. This was his occupation until the outbreak of the great civil war in 1862, when he undertook the duty of nursing the sick and wounded. Mr. Rosetti, to whom I am indebted for these particulars, adds that it was through Emerson's intervention that Whitman obtained President Lincoln's sanction to carry on this work of charity 'without fee or reward,' and to draw army rations. Howe'er it be, we know that the 'Concord sage' was one of the first to recognise Whitman's merits, in a letter addressed to the poet, greeting him 'at the beginning of a great career;' and pronouncing Leaves of Grass 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' As a hospital nurse, Whitman proved the nobleness of his nature by his untiring devotion to the sick and wounded, and a tenderness almost womanly in its extremity. Some of his most striking poems are the outcome of his experiences whilst fulfilling the self-imposed duties of this charitable office. In 1864, Whitman caught his first severe illness, from the absorption of poison into his system whilst attending to 'some of the worst cases of gangrene,' and was incapacitated for a period of six months, but in 1865 returned to the hospitals, and also obtained a clerkship in the department of the Interior, from which he was dismissed because of the free speech on things of a gross nature, in Leaves of Grass. He has since obtained, like many other eminent American writers, a post under Government, in the department of the Attorney-General. Whitman's dismissal from the department of the Interior, which was enforced by Secretary Harlan, caused some little indignation and a pamphleteering controversy: hence his reinstatement to Government employment.</p><p>In manners and habit of life, Whitman is peculiar. The privilege of genius to be eccentric would appear to be exercised in his case to the full; but his eccentricity and genius are en rapport, and bear a singular consistency. Rugged, plain, outspoken, and sensitive in his verse, the poet is the same in his daily life. Mr. Conway has, however, in an article in the Fortnightly Review for October, 1866, given an admirable account of a visit to the poet who, he states, he searched out with a view of giving some report concerning him to his friends. After detailing how he found the small, wooden house of two stories, in which Whitman resided, 'after journeying through the almost interminable and monotonous streets which stretch out upon the fish-shaped Panmanok,' Mr. Conway adds:—</p><p>'The day was excessively hot—the thermometer at nearly 100 deg., and the sun blazed down as only on sandy Long Island can the sun blaze. The common had not a single tree or shelter, and it seemed to me that only a very devout fire worshipper could be found there on such a day. No human being could I see at first in any direction; but just as I was about to turn, I saw, stretched upon his back and gazing up straight at the terrible sun, the man I was seeking. With his grey clothing, his blue grey shirt, his iron grey hands, his swart sun-browned face and bare neck, he laid upon the brown and white grass—for the sun had burnt away its greenness—and was so like the earth upon which he rested, that he seemed almost enough a part of it for one to pass by without recognition. I approached him, gave my name, and my reason for finding him out, and asked him if he did not find the sun rather hot. 'Not at all too hot,' was his reply; and he confided to me that this was one of his favourite places and attitudes for composing 'poems.' He then walked with me to his home, and took me along its narrow ways to his room—a small room of about fifteen square feet, with a single window looking out on the barren solitude of the island—a small cot, a washstand, with a little looking glass hung over it from a tack in the wall, a pine table with pen, ink, and paper on it, an old line engraving representing Bacchus hung on the wall, and opposite a similar one of Silenus. These constituted the visible endowments of Walt Whitman. There was not, apparently, a single book in the room. In reply to my expression of a desire to see his books, he declared that he had very few. I found upon further inquiry that he had received only such a good English education as every American lad may receive from the public schools, and that he now had access to the libraries of some of his friends. The books he seemed to love best, were the Bible, Homer, and Shakespeare; these he owned, and probably had in his pocket while we were talking. He had two studies, where he read; one was the top of an omnibus, and the other a small mass of sand—then entirely uninhabited—far out in the ocean, called Coney Island. . . . I could not help suspecting that he must have had masters, but he declared that he had learned all that he knew from omnibus drivers, ferry boat pilots, fisherman, boatmen, and the men and women of the markets and wharves. These were all inarticulate poets, and he interpreted them. The only distinguished contemporary he had ever met, was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn, who had visited him. He had, he said, asked Mr. Beecher what were his feelings when he heard a man swear; and that gentleman having admitted that he felt shocked, he (Whitman) concluded that he still preferred keeping to the boatmen for his company.' Mr. Conway says that Walt Whitman impressed him favourably, socially, physically, and intellectually, and he adds his praise, not unmixed with surprise, to the testimony of Emerson in his favour. Thoreau, Robert Buchanan, Swinburne, and others, have also recognized Whitman's genius; and what, perhaps, is even more satisfactory still to Whitman, he has gained the love and admiration of thousands of his countrymen, who see in his poems the expression of their national nature and spirit.</p><p>Space does not allow of a criticism of Whitman's poetry, but we subjoin a specimen of his verse. The spirit of Democracy breathes through every line that he has set to paper, although in many of his pieces he mistakes the conception of a poetic idea in his own mind for the expression of it.</p><p>In the case of Whitman's poetry comparison becomes impossible. He stands single and alone in the poetic circle—the personification of Democracy. The verses given below are not chosen because of superior merit, but simply as illustrating different phases of the poet's mind:—</p><p><em>1861.</em><br>ARMED year! year of the struggle!<br>No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year!<br>Not you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas piano;<br>But as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying <br>a rifle on your shoulder,<br>With well gristled body and sunburnt face and hands—with a knife in <br>the belt at your side,<br>As I heard you shouting loud—your sonorous voice ringing across the <br>continent;<br>Your masculine voice, O year, as, rising amid the great cities,<br>Amid the man of Manhattan I saw you, as one of the workmen, the <br>dwellers in Manhattan;<br>Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,<br>Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the <br>Alleghanies;<br>Or down from the great lakes, or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the <br>Ohio river;<br>Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at Chatta- <br>nooga on the mountain top,<br>Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limb, clothed in blue, bearing <br>weapons, robust year;<br>Heard your determined voice, launched forth again and again;<br>Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipped cannon,<br>I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.</p><p><em>NOCTURN FOR THE DEATH OF LINCOLN.</em><br>O CAPTAIN! my captain! our fearful trip is done!<br>The ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring.<br>But, O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot<br>Where on the deck my captain lies,<br>Fallen Cold and Dead.</p><p>O captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells!<br>Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills;<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you the shore's a-crowding;<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning.<br>O captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you.<br>It is some dream that on the deck<br>You've fallen cold and dead.</p><p>My captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will;<br>But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed and done;<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won!<br>Exult O shores! and ring O bells!<br>But I, with silent tread,<br>Walk the spot; my captain lies<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p>",

	"title": "The Poems of Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p><strong>The Poems of Walt Whitman</strong></p><p>The poems of Walt Whitman have been much praised and wondered at in this country since they were published here by Trübner and by Hotten, but though they are of the most decidedly and avowedly spiritualistic character, nobody seems to see that fact. They are in a singular, unrhymed style; sometimes in irregular hexameters, sometimes in the Ossianic metre, sometimes in that of Hiawatha, sometimes absolutely prosaic, but always original and audaciously American. We do not rate him, like one of his editors here, as one of the greatest poets that ever lived, but he is unquestionably a great and original poet. He sets all conventionality at defiance. He is as free in his style, his thoughts, his sentiments, as the most Yankee and pretentious of his countrymen. His brag about the Great Republic and everything belonging to the States is of the most preposterous and laughable kind. His exuberance of imagery, his cataloguings of everything that comes in his head of every possible thing in this globe, or in the universe, is frequently oppressive; but amidst all this extravagance, verbiage, and tautology there rises a continual stream of the brightest new thoughts, the tenderest and most dewy sentiments and kindly human feelings, like the cool and rapid rushing of a mountain-born river beneath the green boughs of the forest or through the flowery grass of the summer meadow. The character of the philosophy of these poems, however, is what we desire now particularly to call attention to. It is of that advanced and transcendental kind which belongs only to writers who have been baptized into the true Jordan of Spiritualism, and have ascended from its banks into the borders of the Summer Land, walking there with ever-increasing wonder, and bringing thence the flowers and fruits of a new and eternal promise; grapes of the true vine; and golden gatherings from the trees of both knowledge and life. All such visitors of the world beyond come back with a newness of aspect, of manner, of speech, and tone of mind, that are unmistakable. We know them at once by the eye beaming with the light that shines on the mountains of the imperishable; by the joy that flushes the features of those who have walked and talked with the angels; by the broad spirit of sympathy which brings to the earth the illimitable fervour of the heavens, and sees in the smallest thing, in the humblest mortal, the signs of the wonder-working of the Infinite Spirit of creative and supporting Love. This is what we see at once in the poems of Walt Whitman: and he at once responds to our challenge, 'Poet, thou art one of us!' with these words:</p><p>As for me (torn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehement days;)<br>I have the idea of all and am all, and believe in all:<br>I believe Materialism is true, and Spiritualism is true—I reject no part.</p><p>Nor do we: Materialism is as true as Spiritualism when it is united to Spiritualism; it is false, or rather defective only, when it is a mere part.</p><p>In a succeeding poem, we have him clearly in trance, and the impressing spirit speaking through him:—</p><p>Take my hand, Walt Whitman!<br>Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!<br>Such joined unended links, each hooked to the next!<br>Each answering all—each sharing the earth with all.</p><p>What widens within you, Walt Whitman?<br>What waves and soils exuding?<br>What climes? what persons and lands are here?<br>Who are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?<br>Who are the girls? who are the married women?<br>Who are the three old men going slowly with their arms about each other's necks?<br>What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?<br>What are the mountains called that rise so high in the mists?<br>What myriads of dwellings are they, filled with dwellers?</p><p>Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;<br>Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east—America is provided for in the west:<br>Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator;<br>Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends;<br>Within me is the longest day—the sun wheels in slanting rings—it does not set for months<br>Stretched in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon and sinks again;<br>Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,<br>Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian Islands.</p><p>What do you hear, Walt Whitman?</p><p>But Walt Whitman sees and hears everything in the earth. The poem which he calls 'Salut au Monde' is a long one. We have enough of it here to understand it, which readers at large both in America and here have not done, but have showered on the mediumistic poet all the epithets of 'fool, madman, idiot,' which the critic vocabulary can so plentifully furnish, with occasional praise equally extravagant. We have the key, and all is to us lucid as the sky and saner far than his deriders. How perfectly spiritual is this passage,—amongst the sights 'of the deaths of the bodies of Gods'—Christ and others:—</p><p>I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved, saying to the people, Do not weep for me,<br>This is not my true country, I have lived banished from my true country— I now go back there;<br>I return to the celestial sphere, where every one goes in his turn.</p><p>In the 'Song of the Broad Axe' we have the same unmistakable spirit vision:—</p><p>I see the European headsman:<br>He stands masked, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong, naked arms,<br>And leans on a ponderous axe.</p><p>Whom have you slaughtered lately, European headsman?<br>Whose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?</p><p>I see the sunset of the Martyrs;<br>I see from the scaffolds of the descending ghosts,<br>Ghosts of dead lords, uncrowned ladies, impeached ministers, rejected kings,</p><p>Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest.<br>I see those who in any land have died for the good cause;<br>The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out.<br>(Mind you, O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never run out).</p><p>But let us take a few passages as they occur seriatim in the volume. Here is one which again proclaims his purpose:—</p><p>I stand in my place, with my own day, here.<br>Here lands female and male;<br>Here the heirship and heiress-ship of the world—here the flame of materials;<br>Here Spirituality, the translatress, the open-avowed,<br>The ever-tending, the finale of visible forms;<br>The satisfier, after due, long waiting, now advancing,<br>Yes, here comes my mistress, the Soul.</p><p>The Soul!<br>For ever and for ever—longer than soil is brown and solid—longer than water ebbs and flows.<br>I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems;<br>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,<br>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and immortality.</p><p>To be truly spiritual is to be devout, and he adds—</p><p>I say no man has ever been half devout enough,<br>None has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough;<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is.</p><p>But the spiritual poet must shew this:—</p><p>The unseen and the seen;<br>Mysterious ocean where the streams empty;<br>Prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me;<br>Living beings, identities, now doubtless near us, in the air, that we know not of;<br>Contact daily and hourly that will not release me.</p><p>And he proceeds:—</p><p>I will make the true poem of riches,—<br>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward and is not dropped at death.</p><p>And again, of death and the soul:—</p><p>Was somebody asking to see the Soul?<br>See! your own shape and countenance—persons, substances, beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands.<br>All hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them:<br>How can the real body ever die and be buried?<br>Of your real body, and any man's or woman's real body,<br>Item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners, and pass to fitting spheres,<br>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death.</p><p>In the most outward city pageant the open-eyed poet sees what the mere world-eyed mass never sees. In the reception of the Japanese Embassy at New York, he says:—</p><p>I do not know whether others behold what I behold,<br>In the procession, along with the Princes of Asia, the errand-bearers,<br>Bringing up the rear, hovering above, or in the ranks marching;<br>But I will sing you a song of what I behold<br>* * * * * *<br>Not the errand-bearing princes, nor the tanned Japanese only;<br>Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears—the Past, the Dead.<br>The murky night-morning of wonder and fable, inscrutable,<br>The enveloped mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,<br>The North—the sweltering South—Assyria—the Hebrews—the Ancient of ancients,<br>Vast, desolated cities—the gliding Present—all of these, and more are in the pageant procession.</p><p>Yes! to the poet of the opened eye—the spiritual poet and seer—all worlds and ages are open. The walls of Time, the barriers of the distant and of ages are thrown down; the manacles of the flesh are rent asunder; the mortal film has fallen from the eye of the temporal probationer, and, spirit-like, he walks cognizant amid the free things of the imperishable spheres. All times, people, regions, are present with him. He sees everything as it is, and knows better than ever that everything is miracle.</p><p>Let us see what he says on this point:—</p><p><em>MIRACLES.</em></p><p><em>1.</em><br>What shall I give? And what are my miracles?</p><p><em>2.</em><br>Realism is mine—my miracles—Take freely,<br>Take without end—I offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you, or your eyes reach.</p><p><em>3.</em><br>Why! who makes much of miracles?<br>As for me I know of nothing else but miracles,<br>Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,*<br>Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,<br>Or wade with naked feet, along the beach, just in the edge of the water,<br>Or stand under trees in the woods,<br>Or talk with any one I love,<br>Or sit at the table with my mother,<br>Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,<br>Or watch honey-bees busy round the hive, of a summer forenoon,<br>Or animals feeding in the fields,<br>Or birds—or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,<br>Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down—or of stars shining, so quiet and bright,<br>Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;<br>Or whether I go among those I like best, and that like me best—mechanics, boatmen, farmers,<br>Or among the savans—or to the soirée—or to the opera,<br>Or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,<br>Or behold children at their sports,<br>Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,<br>Or the sick in the hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,<br>Or my own eyes and figure in the glass;<br>These, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,<br>The whole referring—yet each distinct and in its place.</p><p><em>4.</em><br>To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,<br>Every inch of space is a miracle,<br>Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same;<br>Every cubit foot of the interior swarms with the same;<br>Every spear of grass—the frames, limbs, organs of men and women, and all that concerns them,<br>All these are to me unspeakably perfect miracles.</p><p>To me the sea is a continual miracle;<br>The fishes that swim—the rocks—the motion of the waves—the ships with men in them,<br>What stranger miracles are there?</p><p>But enough: our object is not to bring forward all the spiritual matter of the volume—for it is all spiritual; we want only to shew our readers that another spiritual poet is amongst us, whom the world accepts because it thinks him merely eccentric and original. The poetry of Harris is very fine, but then he said out plumply that the spirits of departed poets gave it him, and the wise ones turned up their eyes and went on. Walt Whitman does not say that any spirit gave him these poems, but he shews it in every line to the initiated. It is alive with that fresh, new, piquant, magical life that no mere poet of the world, no Browning, or Swinburne, or Locker has. The moment that you dip into this poetry, you feel the stir and heavings of the limitless ocean of the God-world of deathless powers beneath; you are immersed in the eternal springs and streams of primal being. The harmonies and airs of the Summer Land are around you. You see and hear and feel and know with a new rush of faculties and consciousnesses which make even the most surprising of material discoveries flat and poor, for they penetrate only into the outer surface of outer things. Here you touch the fire-springs of creative life; you bathe in the life fountains; you are one with the countless hosts of the wise, the beautiful, the loving, who have emerged from the larva cells of earth into the perfected zones of eternal peace and poetry. What says your poet of his state there?</p><p>I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things and the reasons of things:<br>They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen.</p><p>His companions are yours: hear again!</p><p>Wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and hardly cover them.—Beyond these I pass,<br>Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go,<br>Solitary, smelling the earthly smell, stopping now and then in the silence;<br>Alone I had thought—yet soon a silent troop gathers around me;<br>Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms and neck.<br>They, the spirits of friends dead or alive—thicker they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,<br>Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them.<br>* * * * * * *<br>And twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,<br>And stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar.<br>These, I, compassed around by a thick cloud of spirits,<br>Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,<br>Indicating to each one what he shall have—giving something to each.</p><p>With your poet you say finally—</p><p>Now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, I will measure myself by them;<br>And now, touched with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along as those of the earth,<br>Or waiting to arrive, or passed on farther than those of the earth,<br>Thenceforth I no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,<br>Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.<br>O I see now that life can not exhibit all to me—as the day can not,<br>I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.</p><p>Thus daily, whilst the earth porers of science pause and wonder, and then shrink from their own wondering, the broad day of the soul breaks more broadly; rushes on more peremptorily; spirits, issuing from their shy seclusion, speak out aloud, sing in troops and choruses to ears no longer astonished; come visibly and palpably; scatter over us flowers of heaven and of earth, make fire innocuous and touch disease into health; and poets, springing up here and there in the crowds, utter words of faith and vision ever and ever more startling and strong. It is high time that he that would have the credit of being wise should revise his wisdom, and let the mingling earth and heavens speak out to him of the new birth of things—new facts, new perceptions, new sights more wonderful than dreams, new sense of things, of justice, love, truth, pacification, and law—God in his world living through all in one perpetual and illimitable miracle.</p><p>I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!<br>That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it!<br>And all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and death are altogether for it!</p><p>And this invincible conviction is the backbone and substance of the new dispensation in which the poet tells us in his preface,'From the eyesight proceeds another eyesight, and from the hearing proceeds another hearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious of the harmony of things with man.'</p><p>True, Walt Whitman! True! Sing on, and let the whole world know it.</p><p>W. H.</p><p>———</p><p>* New York.</p>",

	"title": "American Poets [Part 1]",
	"body": "<p><strong>American Poets [Part 1]</strong></p><p>WE have many examples in history of a national literature built up in a dialect, but America seems to stand alone in possessing a distinct literature composed in the mother tongue. The war of independence, the final separation of the two countries, the lapse of nearly a century since the latter event, the great difference between the natural scenery of the United States and England, the composite character of their population, and the ever-increasing influx of Germans and other foreigners, have all operated in directions wide of ours as to the forms of the expression of thought, yet have, nevertheless, left the higher literature, and particularly the romance and poetry, of the Republic, absolutely identical with our own as to language. But in spite of this identity of language, the poetry of America is strictly national. It has a flavour of its own, like an American apple. It differs as completely from English poetry as a prairie from a moor, an acacia mimosa from a sensitive plant, sassafras and maple from birch and oak, or a squatter in a log-hut from a farm labourer in a cottage. Though it is, like the poets who produced it, the offspring of England, it has grown up under foreign skies, unlike its parent as the Mississippi is unlike the Thames and the Alleghany mountains differ from the Snowdon range. In the aboriginal Indian traditions, in particular, American poets have sources of originality so abundant that we have nothing that can be compared with it among ourselves. The Celtic and Gaelic legends, which gleam brightly through the pages of Ossian and the 'Irish Melodies,' are faint in comparison with the Indian traditions that blaze through the 'Song of Hiawatha.'</p><p>It is to scenery, principally, that poets in general are indebted for their hold on the minds of others. Important as it is that they should be melodious, should sound the depths of the human heart, and depict exactly the lights and shades of character, it is to scenery, or, in other words, to nature, that they owe their most striking images and illustrations. The American poet has a rich treasury of poetic imagery in his native land. In variety and grandeur, it can hardly be equalled. It is as marked as the imagery of Hafiz, Saadi, and the Sanscrit drama, and has many more elements of strength. For distinctness and beauty it stands beside the imagery of Sicily in the Idyllia of Theocritus; of Mantua and Cremona in the Bucolics of Maro; of Castile and Navarre in the Spanish ballads translated by Lockhart; of Windsor Forest in Pope and Shelley's 'Alastor'; of the Rhine and the Hartz Mountains in the songs of Goethe and the lyrics of Schiller. 'The Americans,' says Walt Whitman, 'of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto, the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir. Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night. Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations. Here is action untied from strings, necessarily blind to particulars and details, magnificently moving in vast masses.'</p><p>Let us take a few pictures of American scenery drawn by master-hands. They will be found to have a cachet all their own.</p>",

	"title": "American Poets [Part 2]",
	"body": "<p><strong>American Poets [Part 2]</strong></p><p>We endeavoured in our last number to show the natural advantages possessed by American poets, and the clear reflection of national scenery to be found in their works. We traced the rise of American poetry, and passed briefly in review the writings of Mrs. Sigourney, the chief poetess of the United States, of the classical William Cullen Bryant, the Catholic aspects of Longfellow, the Quaker-like purity of Bayard Taylor's verse, the Catholic poetry to be found in periodicals, and the moralizing humour of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Resuming our subject at the point where we were obliged to break off, we now proceed with our intended sketch of those poets in America who have distinguished themselves most highly in their own country, and have the best claim to be welcomed in ours.</p><p>In his 'Incident in a Railway car,' James Russell Lowell has inserted what seems to give his ideal of poetry—at least of poetry in his own hands.</p><p>Never did Poesy appear<br>So full of heaven to me, as when<br>I saw how it would pierce through pride and fear<br>To the lives of coarsest men.</p><p>It may be glorious to write<br>Thoughts that shall glad the two or three<br>High souls, like those far stars that come in sight<br>Once in a century;—</p><p>But better far it is to speak<br>One simple word, which now and then<br>Shall waken their free nature in the weak<br>And friendless sons of men;</p><p>To write some earnest verse or line<br>Which, seeking not the praise of art,<br>Shall make a clearer faith and manhood shine<br>In the untutored heart.</p><p>He who doth this, in verse or prose,<br>May be forgotten in his day,<br>But surely shall be crowned at last with those<br>Who live and speak for aye.</p><p>In accordance with this view, James Russell Lowell has declined from the higher walks of poetry—from rivers raging among rocks and trees bronzed with Indian summers—from ideas and scenes such as would have rejoiced Keats, Shelley, and Tennyson$to give vent to his political principles in humorous pieces written in the Yankee dialect. His fame was made by the 'Biglow Papers,' which may be regarded as an anathema on the Mexican War; and in these Papers his democratic proclivities and his burning hatred of slavery recommend themselves to notice in musical and comic verse. They are pervaded also with moral earnestness, and marked by strange spelling, colloquial familiarities, and frequent allusions to Holy Writ. The phraseology is often scriptural, and the irreverence which they display must be ascribed, not to the author, but to the habits of the people whose patois he adopts. Englishmen cannot but be shocked when the Supreme Being is treated with American freedom. But beneath Lowell's free-and-easy diction, his rude and homely satire, and never-failing fun, there is a substratum of fine feeling, scholarship, and sound sense, which compensates for many flaws. We would rather see the name of God used with honest, though undue familiarity, than ignored altogether, as by Walt Whitman, the apostle of matter and the idolater of the flesh. The following stanzas, taken from the anti-slavery poem, the 'Cruetin Sarjint,' will illustrate our point.</p><p>Ez for war, I call it murder-<br>There you hev it plain an' flat;<br>I don't want to go no furder<br>Than my Testyment fer that;<br>God hez said so plump an' fairly,<br>It's ez long ez it is broad,<br>An' you've gut to git up airly<br>Ef you want to take in God.</p><p>'Taint your eppyletts an' feathers<br>Make the thing a grain more right;<br>'Taint a follerin' you bell-wethers<br>Will excuse ye in His sight;<br>Ef you take a sword an' dror it,<br>An' go stick a feller thru,<br>Gu'ment aint to answer for it,<br>God'll send the bill to you.</p><p>Wuts the use o' meetin-goin'<br>Every Sabbuth, wet or dry,<br>Ef it's right to go amowin'<br>Feller-men like oats an' rye?<br>I dunno but wut it's pooty<br>Trainin' round in bobtail coats,—<br>But it's curus Christian dooty<br>This ere cuttin' folks's troats<br>∗∗∗∗∗<br>Jest go home an' ask our Nancy<br>Whether I'd be sech a goose<br>Es to jine ye,—guess you'd fancy<br>The eternal bung waz loose!<br>She wants me fer home consumtion,<br>Let alone the hay's to mow,—<br>Ef you're arter folks o'gumption,<br>You've a darned long row to hoe.</p><p>Who would suspect that this comic strain proceeded from the author of 'My Study Window,' and 'Among my Books'—volumes of essays replete with every sign of extensive learning and refined taste? If Lowell's Essays have a literary fault, it is that they are too clever—full to over flowing of pointed allusions, images, and anecdotes. It would be well sometimes if his mind were less wealthy, or if he forgets some of his riches. He takes us too often off the line, to pick up a beautiful shell, or admire a choice plant. He overcharges his page with illustrations. His luxuriance resembles that of many a plain in Southern climes, where you are knee-deep in flowers and cannot make way through the long grasses and aromatic shrubs. If such be the opulence of Lowell's prose, it would be surprising if his poetry, whether serious or humorous, were not marked by peculiar beauties. The 'Cathedral' and 'Under the Willows, and other Poems' cannot fail to gratify all who can distinguish between verse and poetry. Lowell does not merely imitate beauty, he creates it; and the creation of beauty is the essence of poetry. In all compositions which have been really received as poems, we shall find that the imaginative or, speaking more properly, the creative parts only, have insured them their success. This essential, for which we sigh so often in reading what would be poetry and is only rhyme, or perhaps not even that, is decidedly not wanting in Lowell's effusions. They have in them a principle of life, a subtle ingenuity and an inward glow. The word and the thought are as bride and bridegroom, according to that spirited precept:—</p><p>Sei die Braut das Wort<br>Bräutigam der Geist.</p><p>'The Heritage,' for example, concentrates much power and feeling in exalting the lot of the poor above that of the rich. There may be some straining of the argument, some special pleading, some designed forgetfulness of the many temptations inseparable from poverty, but poetry is not always to be taken au fond de la lettre; it is enough for poetic purposes that it treats any one subject beautifully and satisfactorily from a particular point of view. 'The Dandelion' is another of Lowell's poems enfolding in its bosom much poetic wealth. He speaks of the flower as 'fringing the dusty roads with harmless gold'; of children as 'high-hearted buccaneers,' who pluck and hold up the dandelion, 'o'erjoyed, that they an El Dorado in the grass have found'; he calls it 'the Spring's largess,' which most hearts never understand to take at God's value. He encircles it, in short, with the rainbow colours of a heart alive to the delicate traceries of Nature's hand. He is full of feeling, without sentimentality, and full of art without being artificial. Granted that the highest and most spiritual condition of man is one of continuous joy and content, there is, nevertheless, something in humanity so sad, so compassed about with every species of infirmity, that poetry loses half its power and sweetness when it ceases to make pain beautiful and sighs melodious. Lowell has all the wailing which belongs to a child of song, and perfectly understands how tears are expressive of the deepest emotions, whether of sorrow or joy. Yet he is full of hope, and believes that mainspring of all heroic deeds and sufferings to be divine in its nature and origin:—</p><p>Nor is he far astray who deems<br>That every hope, which rises and grows broad<br>In the world's heart, by ordered impulse streams<br>From the great heart of God.<br>God wills, man hopes.</p><p>Rich as we are in poets of our own country, we often find it difficult to believe that, in the commerce of the mind, we have much to gain by the importation among us of poetry of the United States. Longfellow, indeed, we have long regarded almost as one of ourselves, but with this exception there is among English readers in general little knowledge or appreciation of American poetry. We are apt to look on Yankees in the mass as vulgar, sectarian, swaggering, democratic, money-worshiping folk, who have degraded the English language to a colonial level. But whatever advantages the Mother Country may have over the new Republic, they are balanced, and the Americans would think overbalanced, by advantages on the other side. Purity of style and diction is certainly not lost among their writers of the higher order, and in the vast territory of the United States there is more than enough material for artists, novelists, and poets of every kind and degree. John Greenleaf Whittier is a poet who deserves to be better known in England for his 'Songs of Labour,' 'Home Ballads,' and 'Voices of Freedom.' He is doubtless a mild poet; but mild poetry, like mild air, mild weather, and a mild climate, has its charm. Let no one think that genius is absent from smooth and faultless versification. It may not indeed be genius of the highest order, yet without genius metric melody can never be produced. A critic of some ability has said 'This power over verse, as it is one of the most primary, so also do we regard it as one of the most final tests of a true poetic vocation. . . . other powers may be preferred for dignity or value; none is more of the essence of the art of poetry, or so positively discriminates that from all other forms of art. None, therefore, is more essential the poet, or more symptomatic of his rank.' Metric melody, also, seldom stands alone; the very power which produced it is a guarantee for the possession of other cognate powers; and hence we find that, in almost all cases, the melody of a composition is the measure of its ideas and images also. There is another piece by Whittier well known among us in consequence of its being so often recited at Penny Readings and such-like entertainments. It is 'Maud Miller,' she who—</p><p>On a summer's day,<br>Raked the meadow sweet with hay.<br>Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth<br>Of simple beauty and rustic health.<br>Singing she wrought, and her merry glee<br>The mock-bird echoed from his tree.</p><p>Well; it is a simple tale—a mere nothing to tell—but very beautiful and very touching. A judge rides by; he draws his bridle in the shade of the apple-trees, and asks for a drink of water from the spring at the hands of Maud Miller. And she thinks and she sighs, and sighs and thinks how she should like to be a judge's wife; and the judge, riding away, thinks and dreams, and dreams and thinks how he should like to quit the dusty purlieus of the law, and exchange the weary fencing of stifling courts for the</p><p>Low of cattle and song of birds<br>And health, and quiet, and loving words.</p><p>But the judge marries a wife of rich dowry, who lives for fashion, as he lives for power. But often his thoughts revert to the vision of the barefoot maiden raking her hay; and Maud Muller's musings no less often turn on the rider who thanked her so graciously for the cooling draught, and talked so kindly of the hay and the weather,</p><p>the grass and flowers and trees,<br>Of the singing birds and the humming bees.</p><p>Now mark the conclusion, which for delicacy of touch may match with the workmanship of any master-hand.</p><p>Alas for maiden, alas for judge,<br>For rich repiner and household drudge!<br>God pity them both, and pity us all,<br>Who vainly the dreams of youth recall:<br>For all of sad words of tongue and pen,<br>The saddest are these—'It might have been!'<br>Ah well! <em>for us all some sweet home lies<br>Deeply buried from human eyes;<br>And in the hereafter, angels may<br>Roll the stone from its grave away!</em></p><p>It is better to analyze one poem than to make general remarks on a dozen. The 'Brother of Mercy' exhibits Whittier's peculiar style and distinctive merits in a brief compass. A porter by the Pitti wall in the Val d' Arno is lying on his mat, about to die, while a barefoot monk of La Certosa sits at his side. A Brotherhood of Mercy, in their black masks, is seen moving in that direction, and Piero Luca, the porter, laments that, for the first time their bell has sounded during forty years, he is unable to join in their merciful task. He loved the work, he says; it was its own reward. He did not count on it as an offset against his sings, or as lessening his debt to the free grace and mercy of his Lord. The monk endeavours to console him with the prospect of eternal rest, the white robe and the golden crown. But Piero tosses on his sick pillow, and says in the most naïve humility and, if we may say so, hallowed misconception of the heavenly world—</p><p>Miserable me!<br>I am too poor for such grand company;<br>The grown would be too heavy for this grey<br>Old head; and, God forgive me if I say,<br>It was hard to sit there night and day<br>Like an image in the Tribune, doing nought<br>With these hands that all my life have wrought<br>Not for bread only, but for pity's sake.<br>I'm dull at prayers: I could not keep awake<br>Counting my beads. Mine's but a crazy head,<br>Scarce worth the saving if all else be dead.<br>And if one goes to heaven without a heart,<br>God knows he leaves his behind his better part.<br>I love my fellow-men: the worst I know<br>I would do good to. Will death change me so<br>That I shall sit among the lazy saints,<br>Turning a deaf ear to the sore complaints<br>Of souls that suffer? Why, I never yet<br>Left a poor dog in the strada hard beset,<br>Or ass o'erladen! must I rate man less<br>Than dog or ass, in holy selfishness?<br>Methinks (Lord, pardon, if the thought be sin!)<br>The world of pain were better, if therin<br>One's heart might still be human, and desires<br>Of natural pity drop upon its fires<br>Some cooling tears.</p><p>The perceptions of the poor monk reach no further than those of the poor dying porter. He thinks Piero's words profane; he crosses himself; cries 'Madman! thou art lost!' and flies with the pyx in his hands. The conclusion cannot be told better than in the writer's own words:—</p><p>The sick man closed his eyes with a great groan<br>That sank into a prayer—'Thy will be done!'<br>Then he was made aware, by soul or ear,<br>Of somewhat pure and holy bending o'er him,<br>And of a voice like that of her who bore him,<br>Tender and most compassionate: 'Be of cheer!<br>For heaven is love, as God himself is love:<br>Thy work below shall be thy work above.'<br>And when he looked, lo! In the stern monk's place<br>He saw the shining of an angel's face!</p><p>One cannot, of course, fail to see with regret that the god man who wrote this beautiful poetry indulged a perverse animus against the Catholic religion. He might have portrayed the character of Piero equally well without making the monk so stupid as to mistake the dying man's spiritual condition, and so harsh and unjust as to withdraw the last sacrament; for 'he took up his pyx and fled.' That the humble porter should outwit the priest, ad that the angel's face should shine where the monk's was stern, is a transparent Protestant trick. It will suit a large majority of American readers, perhaps of English too, but this is a poor criterion of merit. Il y a parier, says a French writer, que toute idée publique, toute convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.</p><p>The life of Edgar Allen Poe is a melancholy one—the record of a wandering star—of life, genius, happiness, and usefulness marred by the one degrading vice of intoxication, to which he owed his untimely end. With an acute ear for the music of verse, and a keen sense of the beautiful, he wove the chains of earthy passion round the wings of his soul, and dragged her into the dust of death. He might have used the words of the Bishop of Hippo in the 'Confessions,' and have said:— 'Amabam pulchra inferiora et ibam in profundum, et dicebam amicis meis: Num amamus aliquid nisi pulchrum?' Five-and-twenty years have passed away since he expired in a hospital at Baltimore at the age of thirty-eight. He who had himself asked in the 'Black Cat,' 'What disease is like Alcohol? ' died of delirium tremens, yet he still lives in the poems which he wrote, as he himself assures us, without a purpose, because they have each a music inseparable from the sentiment they breathe, and a finish due to consummate taste. 'He had,' says one of his critics, 'an exquisite eye for proportion, and every little poem is carved like a cameo.'</p><p>The misfortunes of many other children of song met in Edgar Allen Poe. Like Bryon, he was a spoilt child, and, like that noble poet also, he lampooned his patron. Like Shelly, he was expelled from his University. Like Sheridan, he married a girl without dowry, like Burns he caroused, and like Savage, he ate in misery the bitter fruits of dissipation. He was as precocious as precocious as Chatterton; and among his misfortunes may be numbered that of having published a volume of poems while still a boy. The strength of wing expended in such premature flights would be turned to better account if reserved to a later day. The rise and growth of youghful vanity would be checked, and more correct taste cultivated for higher efforts. Poe's early effusions, however, were fully of promise, and Mr. James Hannay dwells with enthusiasm on one in particular, entitled 'Helen.' 'Could anything,' he asks, 'be more dainty, airy, amber-bright than this is?' Its elegance is Horatian. It is merum nectar, as Scaliger says of the Ode to Pyrrha.' Yet this poem is said to have been written at fourteen. His playful sonnet 'To Science' may be quoted as a specimen of his youthful faculties. It sins against the laws of the sonnet in its structure, but the expression is graceful, especially in the concluding line.</p><p>Science, true daughter of old Time thou art,<br>Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.<br>Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,<br>Vulture, whose wings are dull realites?<br>How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise?<br>Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering,<br>To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,<br>Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?<br>Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,<br>And driven the Hamadyrad from the wood<br>To seek a shelter in some happier star?<br>Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,<br>The Elfin from the green grass, and from me<br>The summer dream beneath the tarmarind-tree?</p><p>With all his faults, it is to Poe's credit that he has not transferred the irregularities of his life into his verses in any offensive and immodest way. They are like wild flowers, and for the most part, they breathe sweetly. In one, and in one only, we even catch a glimpse of an aspiration after the highest created Beauty in the person of the blessed Mother of our Lord; but we can draw from it no grave conclusion, so incongruous does it seem with the sparking levities in the midst of which it is found, and which moralize too plainly, and say:—</p><p>Alas! his young affections run to waste<br>Or water but the desert.</p><p>The 'Hymn' is as follows, and it is so devoid of poetic merit, that the writer could hardly have thought it worth preserving except as a record of something which God had done for his soul. Yet we cannot be sure even of this much, for in the midst of his orgies he was always conversing with spirits, and pitying beautiful angels seemed, to his disordered fancy, to spread their wings over the living ruins of his soul and body.</p><p>At morn, at noon, at twilight dim,<br>Maria, though has heard my hymn:<br>In joy and woe, in good and ill,<br>Mother of God, be with me still!<br>When the hours flew brightly by,<br>And not a cloud obsured the sky,<br>My soul, lest it should truant be,<br>Thy grace did guide to Thine and thee.<br>Now, when storms of fate o'ercast<br>Darkly my Present and my Past,<br>Let my Future radiant shine<br>With sweet hopes of thee and Thine!</p><p>If he had felt this intensely, he would probably have expressed it in finer poetry, and have applied to it that melodious system of repetition and refrain of which he was a master and the inventor. Tennyson and Swinburne have often imitated his recurrent music, and though this is frequently nothing more than a poetic trick, there are cases in which it admirably expresses genuine and deep feeling. It is on the 'Raven' that Poe's reputation is mainly founded. It was received in the United States with rapturous applause, and the author himself was so intoxicated with vanity as to pronounce it the best poem that ever had been or would be written! It is beyond doubt a masterpiece of versification, and the delight of Music Halls and Assembly Rooms when recited by readers such as Fanny Kemble and Mr. Montesquieu Bellew. It is highly characteristic of Poe when Poe is at his best, yet it is surprising rather than great. 'It may be described,' Lady Pollock says, 'as the remorseful shriek of a troubled conscience; it projects strange phantoms, it is a startling representation of a special form of delirium in a diseased mind, and its peculiarities of rhyme and rhythm force it upon the attention . . . . . . It has more of spasm than of true vitality; but it is not altogether devoid of beauty. Its tricks of manner recommend it to vulgar tastes, and having enjoyed an immense immediate popularity, it is likely to be rated much lower a few years hence than it is now. Already it has sunk below the first estimate formed of it.' The author was indeed poetic rather than a poet. He looked on Life and Nature with a poet's eye, and he encircled himself wherever he went with gorgeous images and smooth cadenzas. Yet with the exception of the 'Raven,' 'Lenore,' and the 'Bells,' he has written sacredly anything that will long defy the rust of time. We cannot do more at present than ring one of his own changes on the 'Bells.'</p><p>Hear the sledges with the bells—<br>Silver bells!<br>What a world of merriment their melody foretells!<br>How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle<br>In the icy air of night!<br>White the stars that oversprinkle<br>All the heavens, seem to twinkle<br>With a crystalline delight;<br>Keeping time, time, time<br>In a sort of Runic rhyme,<br>To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells<br>From the bells, bells, bells, bells,<br>Bells, bells, bells,<br>From the jingling and the tingling of the bells.</p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, now upwards of seventy years of age, was the son of a Unitarian minister, and at one time discharged the like office with his father in Boston, his native city. The charms of literature, however, and of a literary career, withdrew him from the pulpit at an early period of life, and led him to devote all his time and attention to pursuits congenial to his taste. Brighter talents and keener sensibilities than his have seldom been united; but, although they have made him a most successful writer of prose, they have not sufficed to make him a popular or even an agreeable poet. We read his best pieces with an uneasy feeling, and it seems as if the author had composed them with effort and under restraint. Yet, speaking artistically, they are full of truth and beauty. They are poetry, and being such, we can sometimes hardly account for their giving so little pleasure. They rise and fly above the common level; but they lack sunlight on their joyful way, and freedom on their wings. They have no sustained flight. They do not move like Virgil's Dove, who—</p><p>Aëre lapsa quieto,<br>Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.</p><p>They limp, and halt, and start, and leap, and fairly tumble; then mount and play fantastic tricks, sparkle with a sudden fire, and as suddenly are lost in mist. No one can read the forty pages which 'May Day' fills withough feeling convinced that it brings together more lovely images of Spring than were probably ever before collected into so small a compass:—</p><p>The million-handed sculpture moulds<br>Quaintest bud and blossom folds<br>The million-handed painter pours<br>Opal hues and purple dye;<br>Azaleas flush the island floors,<br>And the tints of heaven reply.</p><p>Yet the effect on the whole is not pleasing. Bewildered with a multitude of beautiful objects, we ask for the genius which can reduce them to order, and give them significancy. Seven-syllable lines, moreover, are too jingling to satisfy the ear except in brief lyrics. No amount of exquisite fragments will produce a whole without an adequate design. All Emerson's poems are fragments, and these again are fragmentary. His disjecta membra wants a uniting idea. What are oases of surpassing beauty, if severed from each other by sands, and brushwood, and swamp? Of all he has written in verse the 'Poet' and the 'Humble Bee' are the least open to this censure. There we find a store of poetic ideality, the finest perception, and a way of expressing things truly original. If he only had a true system in his head, he would be a glorious poet in spite of artistic defects. But he has one. He has all his life been striving to elaborate one, and he has not succeeded. An oppressive vagueness and insufficiency pervades his verse, because he is ever teaching what he has not learned. He would be an apostle of truth, and he knows not what truth is. Beauty, that is created beauty, he knows and loves. He has been from his youth</p><p>. . . . A forest seer<br>Minstrel of the natural year,<br>Foreteller of the vernal ides,<br>Wise harbinger of spheres and tides;<br>A lover true, who knew by heart<br>Each joy the mountain-dales impart:<br>It seemed that Nature could not raise<br>A plant in any secret place,<br>In quaking bog, on snowy hill,<br>Beneath the grass that shades the rill,<br>Under the snow, beneath the rocks,<br>In damp field known to bird and fox,<br>But he would come in the very hour<br>It opened in its virgin bower,<br>And tell its long-descended race.<br>It seemed as if the breezes brought him,<br>It seemed although the sparrows taught him,<br>As if by secret sight he knew<br>Where in far fields the orchis grew<br>Many events are in the field<br>Which are not shown to common eyes,<br>But all her shows did Nature yield<br>To please and win this pilgrim wise.<br>He saw the partridge drum in the woods,<br>He heard the woodcock's evening hymn,<br>He found the tawny thrush's broods,<br>And the shy hawk did wait for him.<br>What others did at distance hear,<br>And guessed within the thicket's gloom,<br>Was shown to the philosopher,<br>And at his bidding seemed to come.</p><p>Almost all the requirements of poetry are fulfilled in these suggestive lines; but it is not often that we find in his verse a long passage so well sustained, so delicate and perspicuous. Thirty-five years have passed since public attention was called to the strangely perplexed system of thought which he had to propound. It was on a Sunday evening in July, 1838, that he delivered an address to a senior class in Divinity College, Cambridge, and discussed from the most transcendental point of view the questions of man in his relations to the universe; of Christ and Christianity; the actual state of religion, and similar lofty themes. He developed in his lecture what some termed a 'Sublime Creed,' and others described as an 'Idealistic Pantheism.' It was, in fact, like many of his subsequent works, a rifacimento of the speculations of Carlyle and Coleridge, hard to be understood, and strongly spiced with the transcendentalism of Germany. A definite creed only can support a solid superstructure of verse. The mythology of ancient Greece and Rome had a certain grandeur, artistically considered, because it was at least definite, and the same may be said of Protestant poetry, so far as it retains the fundamental doctrines of the Faith; but when a poets brains are addled by the pantheistic doctrines of Hegel, Schelling, Fichte, and Jean Paul, his verses are inevitably marked by feebleness and obscurity. This it is which mars the music of many a mighty master of German song, and often makes their hymns and aspirations like sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And this leads us to observe another fatal blemish which Emerson has in common with many writers of the Victor Hugo stamp. He insults the majesty of the Son of God by extolling Him as a man, by placing Him in the list of heroes and sages, side by side with reformers and legislators, 'kings and saviours' of high repute. Thus in his 'Song of Nature' he speaks of</p><p>One in a Judæan manger, [Christ]<br>And one by Avon stream, [Shakspeare]<br>One over against the mouths of Nile, [Saul of Tarsus]<br>And one in the Academe. [Plato]</p><p>And so again in one of those quatrains in which he was fond of completing a thought, in imitation of Goethe and Schiller:—</p><p>I see all human wits<br>Are measured but a few,<br>Unmeasured still my Shakspeare sits,<br>Lone as <em>the blessed Jew.</em></p><p>'Hans Breitmann's Ballads,' by Charles G. Leland, are one of the many offshoots of Lowell's 'Biglow Papers.' They have imported, however, a new element into the composition of American humorous poetry. The hero, Hans Breitmann, is a native of Germany, and has not been long in the United States. His language, therefore, is a ludicrous mixture of two others, easily amalgamated, because of kindred origin. De Quincey informs us that 'the absurdissimo proposalio' of making English more musical by introducing Italian forms and terminations, 'met with no encouraggimento whaterino;' but he would not have said as much of an alliance between English and German if he could have read Hans Breitmann. There is a coarseness in these poems which will often be offensive to a refined English taste; but in sly satire and broad fun it would be difficult to find anything to surpass them. The bad spelling, the German pronunciation of English, and the admixture of German words, are not mere tricks; there is, besides all this, a substratum throughout of genuine humour. The author's keen sense of the ludicrous is contagious, and he who does not laugh over Hans Breitmann's abandon has no laughter in him. He would be proof against Molière, and Liston could not have disturbed his gravity. The dash of sentiment—and German sentiment too, vague as a mist smitten with a sunbeam—that Hans often throws into his merriest strain is as perfectly amusing as the most patient jokes:—</p><p>Hans Breitmann gife a barty—<br>Vhere ish dat barty now?<br>Vhere ish de lofely golden cloud<br>Dat float on de moundain's prow?</p><p>Vhere ish de himmelstrahlende stern—<br>De shtar of de shpirit's light?<br>All goned afay mit de lager beer,<br>Afay in de ewigkeit.</p><p>Can anything represent more exactly the way in which Germans too often make sentiment take the place of virtue, and principle, in their words and writings, flies of in moonlit effervescence?</p><p>In the 'Philosopede,' again, we have a most facetious skit on the nineteenth-century-men, each of whom strides his bicycle and out runs everybody if he can.</p><p>Herr Schnitzerl makes a philosopede,<br>Von of de puttyest kind,<br>It vent mitout a vheel in front,<br>And hadn't none pehind.<br>Von vheel vas in de mittel, dough,<br>And it vent as sure as ecks,<br>For he shtraddled on the axel dree,<br>Mit derv hell petween his lecks.</p><p>Of course, Shnitzerl and his philosopede came to grief—a circumstance deplored with much pathos:—</p><p><em>Oh, vot ish all dis eart'ly pliss?</em><br>Oh, vot is man's soocksess?<br><em>Oh, vot ish various kinds of dings,</em><br>And vot is hobbiness?<br>Ve find a pank-node in de shreedt,<br>Next dings der pank ish preak;<br>Ve folls, and knocks our outsides in,<br>Vhen ve a ten shrike make.</p><p>So vos it mit der Schnitzerlien<br>On his philosophede,<br>His feet both shlipped outside-vard, shoost<br>Vhen at his exdra shpeed.<br>He felled open der vheel, of coorse;<br>De vheel like blitzen flew!<br>And Schnitzerl he vos schnitz in vact,<br>For it shlished him grod in two.</p><p>Und as for his phiosopede<br>Id cot so shkared, men say,<br>It pounded onward till it vent<br>Ganz tyfelwards afay.<br><em>Boot vhere ish now der Schitzerl's soul?</em><br>Vhere dos his shbirit pide?<br><em>In Himmel droo de endless plue</em><br>It takes a medeor ride.</p><p>One of the editors of the Breitmann Ballads, in speaking of them has said, 'There are abysses under abysses of cryptic and concealed fun'; and it would be difficult to invent a higher commendation. The grotesque language in which they are clothed is not unreal. It is the droll broken English (quite distinct from the Pennsylvanian German) spoken by millions of uneducated or half-educated Germans in America, immigrants chiefly from Southern Germany. They roll on a variety of subjects, social and political, and lay bare many of the rascalities of United States politicians no less than many of the absurdities of German philosophers. Thus in a poem n which the superiority of Germans to all the rest of mankind is maintained, and in which we are told</p><p>Dat der Deutscher hafe efen more intellects dan he himself soopose,</p><p>the speaker frankly avows his inability to understand himself, and adds:—</p><p>Ash der Hegel say of his system—dat only von mans knew<br>Vot der tyfel id meant-und he couldn't tell—und der Jean <br>Richter, too,<br>Who saidt: 'Gott knows I meant somedings vhen foorst dis <br>buch I writ,<br>Boot Gott only wise vot das buch means now—for I haf <br>Forgotten it!'</p><p>Some slight knowledge of German is necessary in order to take in the wit of these Ballads and even their sense, but the editions published by Trübner & Co. are amply provided with glossaries. Mr. Charles G. Leland has just published 'Gaudeamus; Humorous Poems—translated from the German of Joseph Victor Scheffel and others.' The translations are cleverly executed, but translated wit is always cumbrous. Even the 'Jobsiad' of Kortüm is heavy in Mr. Brook's English. The best of the pieces in 'Gaudeamus' are travesties of science, and some of them are occasionally rather coarse. The same may be said of the poems of Bret Harte, which have acquired a popularity in America and in this country far beyond what their merits justify. They are often not only vulgar but profane, and the only excuse for him is, that, having chosen to mould his characters out of the commonest and coarsest kind, he puts such language into their lips as becomes their origin. Sometimes he glazes the clay; paints tender pictures on it; adorns it with little gems of virture or feeling, all the more resplendent because set in a sordid frame. He finds, in short, noble qualities in the loest and roughest of the human race. He has the dry, quaint humour of Artemus Ward and Mark Twain, plus a Bret-Hartean pathos.</p><p>'That Heathen Chinee,' the famous cheater at Euchre, or the American écarté, was Bret Harte's first and great success. There is, no doubt, a depth of humour in it which is very ingenioius, but the wit of Jim and Dow's Flat has too much dross mixed with it to be recommended or approved. Reading poetry used to be regarded as a recreation; it is now made a labour. Persons are now continually exhorted to read what they cannot understand, or what they find as difficult as a Sphinx's enigma. It is not enough that serious poetry, or as it is called, philosophical poetry, should be obscure, humorous verse as well is made as hard to work as a sum in the Binomial theorem. Bret Harte is not free from this algebraic kind of wit. Of course, he would complain of the dulness of his readers and critics. But readers are dull—that is, very often;—and critics—well—they are not impossible to please. When Bret Hare wills, he can be perspicuous enough, as in a fine song called the 'Reveille.' It is worthy of its name. It reminds us of Bürger and Beck, of Simrock, Mosen, Strackwitz, and Herwegh. Bret Harte can be clear even when witty, as in 'Penelope.' He can be almost pathetic, as in 'Fate,' and tenderly descriptive, as in the 'Seabird,' and the 'Mountain Heart's ease.' Here is a specimen of his best manner—peculiar enough, thoughtful, and suggestive. A stranger elegy was never written; yet it scarcely requires a comment. The 'In Memoriam' explains itself,—the 'Watchman of Ephriam,' as Osee says, 'was with my God.'</p><p><em>RELIEVING GUARD</em></p><p><em>T.S.K.—Obiit March 4, 1864.</em><br>Came the Relief.

Mr. William Michael Rossetti was principally concerned in introducing his works into the English market; and when it is remembered that Mr. Rossetti is the bosom friend of Swinburne, our readers will not be surprised to hear that Walt Whitman, as an author, is the embodiment of all that is most opposed to the Catholic religion. It is curious also to observe that Mr. Rossetti's first estimate and admiration of the works of this poet appeared in the Chronicle for July 6, 1867, under the article 'Walt Whitman's Poems.' In consequence of this article, as he himself informs us, he was requested to edit a selection from Whitman's writings. Happily these poems, or Ossianic effusions, fraught with the most dangerous principles, do not come before the world in an attractive shape. A certain rhythm runs through them, but they have no rhyme, except in a few instances, nor are they even in blank verse. They are far less poetic in form than the Psalms and Prophets in Hebrew, or Southey's 'Thalaba the Destroyer,' and may be regarded, as some one has said, 'as a warp of prose amid the weft of poetry.' Thus even in composition, they are but a mongrel breed—a hybrid monstrosity. For this reason indeed, Walt Whitman has adopted his strange attire. It strikes the eye; it imposes by its novelty; it bespeaks the audacious personality of the man himself. He claims to be the man of the period—the voice of Republican America. His claim is admitted by his admirers. He cannot be dealt with as a child or a fool. He is neither. He is the exponent of democracy; the champion of humanity; the nineteenth century incarnate. Man, individual and en masse, that is his theme. For him, evil has no existence, or if it exists, it is well that it should exist.</p><p>I am myself (he says) just as much evil as good, and my nation is—and I <br>say there is in fact no evil,<br>Or, if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to me,<br> as anything else.(<em>Chants Democratic.</em>)</p><p>His grandfather was 'the great Quaker Iconoclast, Elias Hicks,' and as dispositions of mind and body are alike hereditary, we find in the grandson an Iconoclast of another type. Whitman's ambition is to break into pieces every sacred image and construct a theory of humanity entirely his own. That his enthusiasm is genuine may be inferred from the fact of his devoting himself to the care of the sick and wounded, in the field and in the hospitals, during the Civil War between the North and South. It is not, however, the less to be dreaded on that account. Benevolence and Atheism were combined in Shelley, and so are self-sacrifice and Materialism united in Walt Whitman. He was in advance of his time, as to his new doctrine, when he first wrote, and though his materialistic ideas have now become far more common, he is in some respects in advance of his time still. The day of his influence, therefore, is not over, for he is more logical than many of his fellows, and carries out their notions into results from which they themselves would perhaps recoil. He is come, this Auguste Comte in verse, this demolisher of all religion, to 'inaugurate a religion.' They are his own words.</p><p>. . . . The whole earth (he adds) and all the stars in the sky, are for <br>religion's sake.<br>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough;<br>None has ever yet adored or worshiped half enough,<br>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the <br>future is.<br>I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be <br>their religion;<br>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;<br>Nor character, nor life worthy the name, without religion;<br>Nor land, nor man or woman, without religion.</p><p>There is vigour and power enough here, and truth too, if the words were interpreted in a right sense, but whether these long, wavy 'Leaves of Grass' deserve, as poetry, the praises lavished on them by Messrs. Emerson, Rossetti, and Swinburne, we leave to our readers to judge. It is more to our purpose to inquire what is the 'greater religion,' the germs of which Walt Whitman dropped into the earth. It is not, you may be sure, the Catholic religion, nor is it Christianity in any sense, though the Bible is one of the writer's favourite books. It is, as nearly as it may be described, the Religion of Humanity-the religion for which Mazzini fought with the pen and Garibaldi with the sword. You may infer what it is from a passage in the Preface to 'Leaves of Grass' written by the poet himself:—</p><p>There will soon be no more priests. Their work is done. They may wait awhile—perhaps a generation or two—dropping off by degrees. A superior breed shall take their place—the gangs of Kosmos and prophets en masse shall take their place. A new order shall arise and they shall be the priests of man, and every man shall be his own priest. The churches built under their umbrage shall be the churches of men and women. Through the divinity of themselves shall the Kosmos and the new breed of poets be interpreters of men and women and of all events and things. They shall find their inspiration in real objects today, symptoms of the past and future.</p><p>Though this passage is printed as prose, it is quite as much poetry as the 'Leaves of Grass.' It represents the ideas of Comte as developed in his 'Positive Religion.' Yet it must not be supposed that Walt Whitman is a plagiarist in any sense. He does not strictly follow Comte, Mazzini, Victor Hugo, Huxley, or Tyndall , though he may by accident agree with each of them in turn. His system, with its rotten basis, its hideous defects, and its strange admixture of the beautiful and the grand, is all his own. Materialist though he be, to such an extent as to make matter in general, and our bodies in particular divine, he is not a pure materialist; he teaches the immortality of the soul and the body, and in his poems, as by the bedside of the dying, he predicts with the confidence of faith the existence of the soul after death clothed in a finer frame of matter elaborated within us during our earthly life. This is, we believe, a doctrine of many Spiritualists; but Whitman is not properly a Spiritualist any more than a mere Materialist. When we consider the breadth of his system, and the multitude of beautiful truths he has incorporated into it, we cannot but deeply lament that, either through perversity or defective education, or both, he has not been intromitted into the glorious heritage of the Catholic faith, where he would find all that he now holds of good and true under the seal of the Blood of an Incarnate God, to the exclusion of all that he holds also which is earthly, sensual, and devilish. For him, as for Catholics, but under very different conditions, the air around is full of spirits released from their mortal coil. Yet with this and similarly sublime and consoling reflections, he associates occasionally passages and entire poems so corrupt in morals and so indecent in language that they are omitted in English editions of his works. With Whitman, the body is the soul, and the soul is the body; the corpse that we drop in the grave is 'excrementitious'; the real body survives:</p><p>Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners and pass to <br>fitting spheres,<br>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment <br>of death</p><p>It is the soul-body of which he speaks, the magnetic or ethereal body, supposed by some to be formed and still forming within the grosser body which will die. If Whitman could be described in one word, we should call him a Universalist. He has no antagonisms. He accepts all, admires all, loves all. He would embrace all objects, material and spiritual, as if the grasp of his finite intellect were the underlying principle that welds things together, harmonizes all discords, annihilates all distinctions of good and evil, of pain and pleasure, of past and future, time and eternity:—</p><p>I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews;<br>I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god;<br>I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception;<br>I assert that all past days were what they should have been;<br>And that they could no-how have been better than they were,<br>And that to-day is what it should be—and that America is,<br>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than they are.</p><p>If in this place we were discussing systems of philosophy in the United States instead of poetry, it would be necessary to enter more fully into the subject of Walt Whitman's speculations. He is not a mere rhapsodist, nor can he be dismissed as a dreamer or an imbecile. There is more bone and sinew in his pages than in those of any other American poet, and that mainly because his ideas are often new and always daring. But enough has been said here for the guidance of those who are curious about his school of thought, and we must make but one further remark on his character as a poet. Of all American poets he is the most intensely national, and in him the great Democracy of the West has found a man who, as Carlyle says, 'will speak forth melodiously what the heart of it means.' He has given scope to the gigantic ideas of his people, and to their unparalleled activity and progress in every social and scientific department. His verses, like his genius, are shaggy and unshorn, and they shake the land like a herd of buffaloes thundering over the prairie. Nothing more national than his 'American Feuillage,' 'Drum Taps,' and poems on the death of President Lincoln, was ever written; and deeply as we deplore the erratic path into which his eager mind has wandered, we cannot but recognize in his talents a gift of the Most High, and in his writings much that is beautiful and precious in the midst of much that is dangerous and base. Any study of American poetry which did not embrace his works would be imperfect, because he has given it a direction in the line of original and powerful thought. If the Catholic religion should spread more widely in the United States, and obtain a firmer hold, directly or indirectly over the public mind, the divine alchemy of which they are possessed who 'have the unction from the holy One and know all things' might turn much of his alloyed metal into refined gold. Fresh and athletic poetry was what, before Whitman's time, America wanted; and now that the want has in some degree, and under great disadvantage, been supplied, it only remains to impart to the new importation that religious and Christian character which made Dante and Milton rulers in the realms of mind. It is, doubtless, by permission of the All-Wise that poets as well as professors, in America as in England, are ranging themselves with new energy in the ranks of unbelief; but it will be, as ever, the sublime office of the Catholic Church to strike the weapons from their hands, to enrich herself with their spoils, and to yoke them to the triumphant car of him who cometh with dyed garments from Bosra.</p><p>Having said this much of Walt Whitman's compositions, and believing, as we do, that in matter of poetry they represent the American mind and the state of American society more faithfully than any other poems—shadowing forth with a certain wild magnificence the rapid, gigantic, and terrible growth of principles false and true—we ought perhaps to give a further specimen of the strange long sweep and Hebraic recurrences in the verse of this thorough Yankee:—</p><p>Why! who makes much of a miracle?<br>As to me, <em>I know of nothing else but miracles,</em><br>Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan [New York],<br>Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,<br>Or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water,<br>Or stand under trees in the woods,<br>Or talk by day with any one I love,<br>Or sit at table at dinner with my mother,<br>Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,<br>Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,<br>Or animals feeding in the fields,<br>Or birds—or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,<br>Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down—or of stars shining so quiet and <br>bright,<br>Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;<br>Or whether I go among <em>those I like best, and that like me best—mechanics,<br>boatmen, farmers,</em><br>Or among the savans—or to the soirée—or to the opera,<br>Or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,<br>Or behold children at their sports,<br>Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,<br>Or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,<br>Or my own eyes and figure in the glass;<br>These, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,<br>The whole referring—yet each distinct, and in its place.<br>To me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,<br>Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,<br>Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,<br>Every foot of the interior swarms with the same;<br>Every spear of grass—the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women,<br> and all that concerns them,<br>All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles.<br>To me the sea is a continual miracle;<br>The fishes that swim—the rocks—the motion of the waves—the ships, with <br>men in them,<br>What stranger miracles are there?</p><p>In America, as in England, the great poet is still to arise. It is essential that he should be a Catholic—'a poet,' as Emanuel Geibel says, 'by the grace of God' (Poet von Gottes Gnaden). Not that Catholicism need be his subject, but it should underlie it, and circumscribe it, and hold it in solution. He should see all things from a Catholic point of view, yet see more than most who are round about him, and see farther than his age in general. He should have the versatility of Shakspeare, the might of Milton, the faith of Dante, and the perfect language of Tennyson. He should embrace, so far as one man can embrace, all sciences, have the liveliest affinity for the true and the beautiful, wherever found, and the tenderest sympathy with human suffering. He should pierce to the principles underlying facts and binding together disjointed phenomena. He should be as orthodox as the see of S. Peter, yet discern in every error its basis or contingent of truth. He should leave his moral lessons to be inferred, and remember that, for the most part, the mission of the poet is to please rather than to teach. Relying with full confidence on the all-embracing character of his divine religion, he should avoid as a pestilence every species of narrowness, and be content to be often misinterpreted and misunderstood. Originality in a poet is impossible if he be always writing down to the level of inferior understandings. He must be judged by the few, that he may delight the many; and in saying this, we do not for a moment forget that simplicity, directness, perspicuity are the crowning glory of all composition, and especially of poetry. Never before, in the history of mankind, were the materials at a poet's command so rich and varied as they are now. All things are assuming giant proportions—commerce, locomotion, social questions, politics, education, war, sciences, arts. Nature was never observed before as she is now observed, and the novelist's art has laid bare the human heart and depicted the characters of men in such vivid and varied colours as we never saw till of late. Religion itself—our own holy religion—has developed within the present generation, and presented itself to us in a more definite and extended shape than ever. The times are ripe for great poetry and a great minstrel of mankind. Man, the Kosmos, the Bible, the infallible Church, Time, Futurity—what themes! The mere mention of them is inspiring; for what is poetry but the highest truth and the deepest emotion? Express them as you will, there is music in the sound and rhythm in the language. Where will this poet of the future, who makes Catholicism his standpoint, arise? Will England or America have the honour of giving him birth?</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN</strong></p><p>A STRANGELY impudent agitation has just been started with regard to what is called 'Walt Whitman's Actual American Position.' Whitman, it may be explained, is an American writer who some years back attracted attention by a volume of so-called poems which were chiefly remarkable for their absurd extravagance and shameless obscenity, and who has since, we are glad to say, been little heard of among decent people. It now appears that, although there is a small coterie of persons in this country who are not ashamed to confess their liking for Whitman's nastiness, his own countrymen have universally repudiated him. 'The real truth,' says an American journal, which has taken up the subject apparently in the interest of Whitman, 'is that, with the exception of a very few readers, Whitman's poems in their public reception have fallen still-born in this country. They have been met, and are met to-day, with the determined denial, disgust, and scorn of orthodox American authors, publishers, and editors, and in a pecuniary and worldly sense have certainly wrecked the life of their author.' 'No established publishing house will publish his books. Most of the stores will not even sell them.' 'Repeated attempts to secure a small income by writing for the magazines during his illness have been utter failures. The Atlantic will not touch him. His offerings to Scribner are returned with insulting notes; the Galaxy the same. Harper's did print a couple of his pieces two years ago, but imperative orders from head-quarters have stopped anything further. All the established American poets studiously ignore Whitman.' We are of course sorry that Whitman, or any other man, should be in sore distress, but we must say that we are very glad indeed to hear that his writings are unsaleable, and that no respectable publisher or editor in America will give him countenance by printing his contributions. This fact, if it is true, shows that the moral sense of the American public is, after all, not quite so much deadened as some recent events might lead one to imagine. If the New York Herald will not have anything to do with Walt Whitman, it is a proof that even the Herald draws the line somewhere. We can only regret that the same view is not taken by all publishers on this side of the ocean, and that there is one firm at least in London which is not ashamed to advertise a 'complete' edition of Whitman's works. We have no desire to pry into details of Whitman's private life. The description which he gives of himself in his writings as 'disorderly, fleshly, sensual,' and fond of loafing, is not perhaps to be taken in a literal sense; and in any case we have no desire to speculate as to how far his private life may have been imprudent or irregular. The important fact is that he has found it impossible to get a living by his writings, which are everywhere shunned and rejected. Considering the character of these writings, this seems to us a very natural and desirable result, and it is difficult to understand why people should be expected to buy an article which disgusts them. Some of Mr. Whitman's friends and admirers in London have, however, worked themselves into a state of theatrical indignation with regard to the treatment of this great man by his unappreciative and ungrateful countrymen. Mr. Robert Buchanan, who has made himself the mouthpiece of this extraordinary agitation, not only claims for Whitman 'literary immortality,' but exalts his 'ineffable goodness' and 'beneficence,' and declares, in a passage flavoured with a touch of blasphemy which we prefer not to quote, that 'only this last consecration of Martyrdom was wanting to complete our poet's apotheosis.' Mr. Buchanan, being himself a poet, naturally chafes against the restraints of ordinary prose, and we are treated to a wonderful picture, in the highest style of fine language, of a 'golden eagle sick to death, worn with age and famine, or with both, passing with weary waft of wing from promontory to promontory, from peak to peak, pursued by a crowd of prosperous rooks and crows, who fall screaming back whenever the noble bird turns his indignant head, and which follow frantically once more, hooting behind him, whenever he ascends their way.' This is all very fine no doubt in its way, but it may be thought to be hardly a fair description of the case of a dirty bird which is shunned on account of its unclean habits. Mr. Buchanan also breaks out into furious vituperation against all American publishers and men of letters, whom he abuses in the most vulgar terms; and warns the American nation collectively that its 'honour will be tarnished eternally by the murder of its only remaining prophet.' Mr. Buchanan concludes by what is really an insulting appeal to his own countrymen, as 'loving and revering' this apostle of beastliness, to give him 'a substantial proof of the honour in which he is held here in the heart of England.'</p><p>From the height of this rhapsodical outburst it is a sad descent to the prosaic facts of the case. It is of course open to any one who admires, or is simply sorry for, Whitman to subscribe for his support; but it is difficult to understand why those who dislike his flagrant indecencies should be denounced because they do not feel inclined to give him any encouragement. Mr. Buchanan himself, though he does not scruple to rank Whitman with the Saviour, and declares that his teaching is 'as heavenly manna,' thinks it necessary to 'disclaim entire sympathy with Whitman's materialistic idealism, which seems to go too far in the direction of illuminating the execrable.' Mr. Buchanan does not explain exactly what he means by 'execrable,' but in any sense such an admission goes far to justify the distrust and loathing with which Whitman is regarded both here and in America. Mr. Buchanan holds that 'these great experiments in poetry' are 'destined to exercise an extraordinary influence on the future of religion as well as poetry,' and this, he says, 'no one who has read his works will deny.' Public opinion, however, both here and in America, has expressed itself very decisively as to these great experiments; and there is very little chance of Mr. Buchanan or any of his associates bringing the world round to a different view. It is no doubt true that there are many people who have never read Whitman's so-called poetry all through, but enough is known to show that it is an attempt to make animal brutality and indecency pass for poetry. No doubt the present effort to revive curiosity on the subject will be a useful advertisement to any bookseller who happens to have a stock of Whitman's garbage on hand. It must be remembered, however, that his earlier works have been before the public for some twenty years, and that during the whole of that time the opinion originally formed of them has been steadily sustained, and, if possible, intensified; and there is, we imagine, very little danger of this judgment being now reversed by friendly puffery and agitation, even when such great authorities as Mr. Buchanan supposes himself to be take up the matter. There are, no doubt, questions both of art and philosophy on which public opinion at times goes astray; but in the present instance the elementary instincts of mankind are sufficient to settle the question. There would indeed need to be a very remarkable change both in the moral and intellectual constitution of educated people before such writings as those of Whitman could be accepted as, in any sense, honest literature.</p><p>When Mr. Buchanan screeches about 'literary outlawry,' 'murder,' 'official persecution,' he is obviously only talking nonsense. We have no desire to say anything in disparagement of American publishers, but they are no doubt not absolutely exempt from the weaknesses of other tradesmen; and we suspect that, if there really were a market anywhere for Whitman's wares, he would have no difficulty in finding some one to retail them for him. It is reasonable to assume that American publishers and editors know their own business, and that they have sufficient reasons for having nothing to do with Mr. Whitman. He has chosen to identify himself with unsavoury things, and whatever he might now write, his name would be a taint to any respectable periodical. The fact is that it was only the indecent exposure which Whitman made of himself in the first instance that attracted passing attention to him as a sort of psychological monstrosity. Apart from his scandalous eccentricities, his writings are poor stuff, and the affectation of deep philosophy is easily seen through. The assumption that a man who sets himself to outrage public decency should be gratefully supported by public charity is certainly a very curious one. Mr. Buchanan asserts that his idol has many worshippers in this country, but we venture to say that this is a part of his delusion; and we may add that those who are so unfortunate in their tastes as to belong to this sect would perhaps act prudently for themselves in not proclaiming it too loudly. The conclusion would seem to be that the 'illumination of the execrable' is not a remunerative business; and so far the lesson is a useful one, and may be taken to heart by any other writers who have a weakness that way. There is also, however, a general principle underlying Mr. Buchanan's letter which deserves notice. He appears to imagine that society is bound, as a matter of course, to contribute to the maintenance of any one who chooses to set up as a man of genius. The genius may be less apparent than some other characteristics, but society is bound all the same to accept implicitly the claimant's own assurance, and that of a few sympathetic friends, that he is a genius, and to provide for him accordingly. This, we fancy, is a favourite idea with a certain class of poets, who have usually reasons of their own for holding that their incomes ought not to be dependent merely on the popularity of their works and the respect in which they are held by those who know them. Instances can no doubt be mentioned of great poets who were not sufficiently appreciated while alive; but, on the other hand, it would be rather hazardous to undertake to provide for every one who, believing himself to be a poet, could not get a living by his works. We should then have a fine flock of hard-up 'golden eagles' eager to take advantage or public charity. If the appeal on behalf of Whitman were based simply on his age and indigence, we should not think ourselves bound to say anything against it. But the plan proposed is to help him circulate his writings, and thus implies approval of them. It is satisfactory to believe that agitation for such a purpose is likely to prove as futile as it is audacious.</p>",

	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>1. Leaves of Grass By WALT WHITMAN. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>2. Specimen Days and Collect Same author. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>3. Poems of Walt Whitman. Selected and edited by W. M. Rossetti London, 1868.</p><p>4. Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person By JOHN BURROUGHS. New York, 1871.</p><p>5. Walt Whitman By R. M. BUCKE, M.D. Glasgow, 1883.</p><p>IN a letter dated Concord, 6th May, 1856, Emerson wrote to Carlyle:—'One book, last summer, came out in New York, a nondescript monster which yet has terrible eyes and buffalo strength, and was indisputably American, which I thought to send you, but the book throve so badly with the few to whom I shewed it, and wanted good morals so much, that I never dxml:id. Yet I believe now again I shall. It is called Leaves of Grass, was written and printed by a journeyman printer in Brooklyn, New York, named Walter Whitman; and after you have looked into it, if you think, as you may, that it is only an auctioneer's inventory, you can light your pipe with it.'</p><p>The book referred to was a copy of the singular looking thin quarto volume of little more than a hundred pages, in which the Leaves of Grass originally appeared, and which is now so eagerly sought after by American book-collectors. What Carlyle's opinion of it was, whether, as Emerson thought he might, he used it for the purpose of lighting his pipe, or like Emerson, he held it in high esteem for its intrinsic excellence, we have no means of knowing. In the recently published Carlyle-Emerson correspondence there is no further reference to it, and so far as we can remember, no allusion is made to it in any of Carlyle's published writing.</p><p>The reception which this strange 'nondescript monster['] with 'terrible eyes and buffalo strength' met with at the hands of the public and in literary circles was almost as disheartening as possible. Of the thousand copies printed, some, Dr. Bucke informs us, were given away, most of them were lost, abandoned, or destroyed.∗ According to Mr. Burroughs, some sixty copies were deposited for sale in a bookseller's shop in Brooklyn, and as many more in another in New York. Weeks elapsed and not a single copy was sold. Presently there came the request from both the booksellers that the unfortunate thin quarto should be removed. Subsequently the copies found refuge in the warehouse of a phrenological publishing establishment in Broadway, the proprietors of which advertised the work, and sent out copies for review and to distinguished persons. 'The journals,' continues Mr. Burroughs, 'remained silent, and of the copies sent to distinguished persons several were returned with insulting notes. The only reception heard of, was such, for instance, as the use of the volume by the attaches of a leading daily paper in New York—collected in a swarm Saturday afternoon, waiting to be paxml:id off—as a butt and burlesque, whose perusal aloud by one of the party, the other lounging or standing about, was equivalent to peals upon peals of ironical laughter from the whole assemblage.† Cold as its reception by the press was, it was scarcely so silent, however, as Mr. Burroughs' words might lead the reader to suppose. As we learn from Dr. Bucke's extremely useful and handy little volume, it was noticed, though certainly in no very complimentary terms, in the Brooklyn Daily Times, in the London Critic, and in the New York Criterion. Nor was it altogether ignored in higher quarters. It had the honour of being reviewed in Putnam's Magazine, then the most influential and best conducted of the American periodicals. The reception given to it there was probably under the circumstances the best possible. The reviewer filled three columns with extracts from its pages, selecting the most original and striking passages, and passing over those which were calculated to offend, and though he pronounced the new poems to be a 'mixture of Yankee transcendentalism and New York rowdyism,' which were here 'seen to combine in harmony,' and indulged in other pleasantries of a similar nature, he frankly acknowledged that there were to be found 'an original perception of nature, a manly temper, and an epic directness in the new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental school.'</p><p>That any warmer or more encouraging reception should have been accorded to the book was scarcely to be expected. Its singular appearance, its peculiar lines, its utter want of conformity with most of the conventionalities of the poet's art, the obscurity of its author, and above all its seeming want of good morals were against it. Circumstances, however, soon conspired to lift both the volume and its author, if not out of derision, at least out of obscurity. The first and most weighty was the publication of a letter to Whitman from Emerson in which he declared the Leaves of Grass a 'wonderful gift,' and pronounced it 'the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed.' 'I give you joy,' he wrote with his usual cheeriness, 'of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things saxml:id incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.    .   .   .  The solxml:id sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.' Thoreau wrote of the book in a similar, if more guarded, strain. 'On the whole, it sounds to me,' were his words, 'very brave and American, after whatever deductions. I do not believe that all the sermons, so called, that have been preached in this land, put together, are equal to it for preaching. We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He sometimes suggests something a little more than human.' By these and other means public attention was gradually directed to the volume: and when at length a new and enlarged edition appeared in 1856, it awoke a perfect storm of derision and abuse. Indeed, so extreme were the feelings it excited, that, according to Dr. Bucke, a number of persons in New York seriously contemplated instituting proceedings against its author in the courts of law, and were only deterred by the consxml:ideration that, whatever might be the estimation in which his book deserved to be held, Whitman himself was so popular in New York and Brooklyn that it would be impossible to get a jury to find him guilty. But the best piece of good luck that befell Whitman was his dismissal in 1865, by Mr. Harlan, formerly a Wesleyan clergyman, but at the time secretary for the Interior, from a government clerkship he had obtained, on the ground of the alleged immorality of Leaves of Grass. This act at once put the climax to the discussion as to his merits and demerits, and aroused an intense curiosity respecting his volume, and not a little sympathy in his favour.</p><p>On Whitman himself the derision and abuse, which were heaped upon him in true Philistine fashion, had, and have had, little or no permanent effect. Least of all, have they induced him to modify the principles with which he started on his literary career, which, as Emerson rightly divined, 'had a long foreground.' Having carefully settled his principles at the beginning, Whitman has steadily adhered to them, never doubting, and never having the slightest misgivings as to their soundness. Respecting the matter in which he has applied them—a very different thing—he has now and again had serious doubts.</p><p>'Since I have been ill,' he writes in a note to the Preface of 1876, 'I have felt temporary depression more than once, for fear that in Leaves of Grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced.' But in his clearest and calmest moods he has always realized, he tells us, that as the Leaves surely prepare the way for morals and necessitate them, and are adjusted to them just as nature does and is, so they are what, consistently with his plan, they must and should be. The scorn which he naturally felt towards his detractors was mainly of the silent sort. He neither sought to defend his reputation, nor to retaliate on those by whom it was so savagely assailed; nor dxml:id he care much whether he was understood or not. In a poem which does not seem to have been included in the earliest edition, and which is in some respects characteristic, he writes:—</p><p>'I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself, or to be understood;<br>I see that the elementary laws never apologise;<br>(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all),</p><p>'I exist as I am—that is enough:<br>If no other in the world be aware, I sit content;<br>And if each and all be aware, I sit content;</p><p>'One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;<br>And whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million <br>years,<br>I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.</p><p>'My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite;<br>I laugh at what you call dissolution;<br>And I know the amplitude of time.'</p><p>This bold and almost arrogant confxml:idence is now apparently being justified. Though not popular in the sense that he is wxml:idely read, or that his works are to be found, as Whittier's are saxml:id to be, in almost every house in the United States, Whitman has on the American continent a large and increasing circle of readers. Outsxml:ide of America his admirers are more numerous still. Like Fourier, he may be saxml:id to have his propagandists in many lands. On the continent of Europe some of his works have been translated into several languages, while in England, where his worth was early recognised, he has secured the warm, and on the whole judicious advocacy of poets and critics like Swinburne, Buchanan, W.B. Bell, W.M. Rossetti, Symonds, and Professor Dowden, and of his popularity amongst ourselves not the least significant sign is the publication of the two handsome volumes, the titles of which we have placed first at the head of this paper.</p><p>In these volumes is contained, it would appear, all that Whitman desires to be preserved of his published writings. The one bearing the title Specimen Days and Collect is, with the exception of one or two juvenile pieces, in prose, and as the title indicates, is of very varied contents. First of all, we have a number of pages in which Whitman gives an account—an account, we may remark in passing, which is not without interest—of his ancestry and early days. Next, we have a number of memoranda written during the war of attempted secession, and here copied verbatim from a series of 'soil'd and creas'd livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket,' and 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain,' having been 'hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom admit the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march.' The memoranda here given from these 'lurxml:id and blood-smutch'd little note-books' bear all the marks of their origin. They are written in swift, vigorous, telling words; while the intense realism by which they are pervaded, and the terrible scenes which they depict, often make their reading exceedingly impressive. Following these, and forming the concluding part of the Specimen Days, is a number of memoranda written during and after the author's recovery from a serious and prolonged illness, brought on by his exertions during the war, and consisting, for the most part, of descriptions of natural and human scenes. They are full of fine thought and feeling, and are frequently not less poetical than some of the finer passages in his poems. In the Collect are included the remarkable essay entitled 'Democratic Vistas,' the prefaces to the various issues of his poems, and a paper on 'American Poetry.'</p><p>Whitman's prose is, in our opinion, not equal to his verse. Passages of great beauty and power occur; but taken as a whole the style is less terse and vigorous. It is marred, too, by mannerisms, and particularly by the frequent occurrence of long and often clumsy parentheses. As a rule the shorter pieces are written in much sounder and healthier English than the longer, though some of these are admirably written, and lead one to suspect, as a not unfriendly critic has observed, 'that his every-day prose is distorted intentionally.' For a right understanding of Whitman's poetry, however, a careful study of his prose writings, and more especially of the section having the somewhat strange, though not all together inappropriate, designation of 'Collect,' is indispensable. It is here that he explains himself, and unfolds the aims and principles by which he is guxml:ided and inspired.</p><p>Leaves of Grass, originally, as we have remarked, a thin quarto of about a hundred pages, has now grown into a goodly sized octavo of nearly four hundred closely printed pages, containing close upon three hundred separate poems. Whitman has given regular titles to comparatively few of them. Most of them are headed instead with their first line or phrase, as, e.g. 'As I pondered in silence,' 'I hear America singing,' 'When I heard at the close of the day.' The greater part of them are distributed under the headings—'Inscriptions,' 'Children of Adam,' 'Calamus,' 'Birds of Passage,' 'Sea-drift,' 'By the Roadsxml:ide,' 'Drum-taps,' 'Autumn Rivulets,' 'Whispers of Heavenly Death,' 'From Noon to Starry Eye,' 'Songs of Parting.' Unconnected as they seem, however, it must not be supposed that they have no connection or are without arrangement. Though without formal connection, they have one which is real, and are intended to be read in the order in which they stand, as what may not unfitly be called an Epic of Life. On first reading, as most readers will probably acknowledge, they are somewhat repellent. There is so much in them we do not expect to find, so little respect is paxml:id to our conventional xml:ideas, and the author obtrudes himself so ostentatiously upon our attention, that after a few lines, we are disposed to throw the book asxml:ide as a compound of egotism and nonsense. On further reading, however, the illusion is gradually dispelled. First the attention is arrested by single lines or isolated passages, and as we proceed we become aware of an intellectual wealth and suggestiveness, a subtle charm, a personal force, a rush and glow of overmastering passion which we have seldom met with elsewhere; and though there are passages from which we turn away with repugnance, we cease to wonder at the warm and extremely eulogistic terms in which the admirers of Whitman are in the habit of speaking of him.</p><p>But whatever our estimate of Whitman's writings may be, Whitman himself is unquestionably a notable figure, certainly one of the most notable America has produced. As Professor Dowden has remarked,—'What cannot be questioned after an hour's acquaintance with Walt Whitman and his Leaves of Grass, is that in him we meet a man not shaped out of old-word clay nor cast in any old-world mould, and hard to name by any old-world name. In his self-assertion there is a manner of powerful nonchalantness which is not assumed; he does not peep timxml:idly from behind his work to glean our suffrages, but seems to say, 'Take me or leave me, here I am, a solxml:id and not inconsxml:iderable fact of the universe.' He disturbs our classifications; he attracts us; he repels us; he excites our curiosity, wonder, admiration, love: or our extreme repugnance. However we feel toward him we cannot despise him. He is a 'summons and a challenge.' He must be understood and so accepted, or must be gotten rxml:id of. Passed by he cannot be.'‡ Nor are the sources of this singular power far to seek. They are to be found not so much in his art, for as an artist he is in some respects confessedly weak, but in the lofty purpose by which he is inspired, and in the ardent, and almost fierce enthusiasm with which he has from first to last devoted himself to it. This purpose, to put it in the fewest words, is nothing less than to inaugurate in America, by means of a genuinely native imaginative literature, a new era of intellectual and spiritual development. Or to put it differently, and to use the eloquent words of W. M. Rossetti, he 'occupies at the present moment a unique position on the globe, and one which, even in past time, can have been occupied by only an infinitesimally small number of men. He is the one man who entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature, and a great one—a literature proportional to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the continent, or the Washington of the States was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America.' This purpose is surely a noble one, and which, if at all seriously followed, cannot fail to be fruitful in extraordinary power. And that this is the purpose which Whitman has continually set before him he has frequently declared. 'Democratic Vistas,' his various Prefaces, and several other of his prose essays may be taken as a sort of apology justifying it. But, nowhere has he given more noble utterance to it, as Mr. Rossetti has also pointed out, than in the following lines:—</p><p>'Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,<br>I will make the most splendxml:id race the sun ever shone upon,<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades,<br>'I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, <br>and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies,<br>I will make inseparable cities with their arms around each other's necks,<br>By the love of comrades<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>'For you, these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme!<br>For you, for you, I am trilling these songs.'</p><p>Besxml:ides an 'imperious conviction and the commands of his nature as total and as irresistible as those which make the sea flow, or the globe revolve,' Whitman's incentives to this great and unquestionably beneficent task are partly in the condition of American society, and partly in the character of American literature.</p><p>The spectacle presented by American society he describes as 'appalling.' Everywhere he sees hollowness, hypocrisy, deceit; in the business classes a depravity 'infinitely greater than has been supposed;' 'corruption, falsehood, and maladministration in branches and departments of the official services, whether national, state, or municipal;' in 'fashionable life flippancy, tepxml:id armours, weak infxml:idelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time;' 'in literature a scornful superciliousness;' 'in the churches and sects the most dismal phantasms usurping the name of religion.' 'The best class we shew,' he writes, 'is but a mob of fashionably-dress'd speculators and vulgarians.' Though an unwavering believer in democracy, and joyfully recognising the 'immense success of the New World democracy in lifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain species of intellectual culture,' he is nevertheless painfully oppressed by the conviction that so far 'in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, esthetic results, it is almost a complete failure,' 'in vain, he exclaims, 'do we march with unprecedented strxml:ides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annexed Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north to Canada and south to Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endowed with a vast and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.' Or take the following passage from the 'Democratic Vistas,' which, while it illustrates his style in prose writing, clearly indicates one at least of the reasons why he has devoted himself to his self-imposed task:—</p><p>'Let me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations, localities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition. After an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and Brooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendour, picturesqueness, and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpassed situation, rivers and bays, sparkling sea txml:ides, costly and lofty new buildings, facades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance of design, with the masses of gay colour, the preponderance of white and blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets, Broadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even at night; the jobbers' houses, the rich ships, the wharves, the great Central Park and the Brooklyn Park of hills (as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)—the assemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades, evening amusements, or along the by-quarters—these, I say, and the like of these, completely satisfy my sense of power, fulness, motion, &c., and give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic conscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always, and more and more, as I cross the east and north rivers, the ferries, or with the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in the Wall Street, or the Gold Exchange, I realize (if we must admit such partialisms) that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests, seas—but in the artificial, the work of man, too, is equally great—in this profusion of teeming humanity—in these ingenuities, streets, goods, houses, ships—these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men, their complicated business genius (not least among the geniuses), and all this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.</p><p>'But sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real importance, personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask—Are there, indeed, men here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons? Is there a great moral and religious civilization—the only justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes, using the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations, phantoms, playing meaningless antics. Confess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room, official chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning, infxml:idelity—everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely ripe—everywhere an abnormal libxml:idinousness, unhealthy forms, male, female, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood, the capacity for good motherhood decreasing or deceased, shallow notions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners (consxml:idering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in the world.'</p><p>Turning to the literature of America, any 'breath recuperative of sane and heroic life' to breathe into these lamentable conditions, Whitman nowhere finds. That which he observes to be everywhere lacking is native or original power. Workers in a certain sort of literature he sees in abundance; but 'touched by the national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality, they wither,' he affirms, 'to ashes.' 'I have not seen,' he remarks, 'a single writer, artist, lecturer, or what not, that has confronted the voiceless, but ever erect and active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the land, in a spirit kindred to itself.' And, again, 'consxml:idered with reference to purposes of patriotism, health, and noble personality, religion, and the democratic adjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic plays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of our best xml:ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish no one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no one, and suffice only the lowest levels of vacant minds.' Morally and artistically, he affirms, America has as yet originated nothing. 'We see the sons and daughters of the New World,' he observes, 'ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the universal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and the dead. We see London, Paris, Italy—not original, superb, as where they belong, but secondhand here, where they do not belong. We see the shreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks, but where on her own soil do we see, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.' The central point of a nation, and that whence it is swayed and sways others, that which consolxml:idates its various parts, and is the source at once of its inspiration and influence, is, he believes, its national literature, and more especially its archetypal poems, but any such literature or poems America, he maintains, does not possess.</p><p>What then is the literature he desires and to what extent has he realised this desire in his own works? The answer to the first of these questions the foregoing paragraphs have already suggested. Those who wish for a fuller and more explicit answer we must refer to Specimen Days and Collect, and more especially to the 'Democratic Vistas,' the Prefaces of 1855 and 1876, and to the essay on 'Poetry To-day in America—Shakespeare—The Future,' where Whitman has unfolded his xml:ideas at consxml:iderable length, and frequently with great eloquence and power. In the space now remaining at our disposal we shall point out one or two of the features of the literature he has produced, premising, however, that many of the questions we shall be obliged to pass over in silence.</p><p>Whitman's principle defect, as a poet, lies, as it seems to us, and as we have already saxml:id, in the direction of his artistic power. That which strikes the reader first on opening Leaves of Grass is the singular appearance of its pages. The ordinary forms of versification Whitman has discarded, and adopted in their stead one which reminds us of Ossian, the writings of the Hebrew prophets, and the Vedas. By his thorough-paced admirers this is claimed as a sign of originality and strength. In our opinion, it is a sign of weakness. A really great poet, one, that is, who is thoroughly perfect in all the branches of his art, is a master of expression. Whitman confessedly is not. After many trials he was forced, he tells us, to give up the attempt to express himself in the forms employed by the great poets of the principal literary nations, and to use the mode he has here adopted. There is running through his works, as Mr. Rossetti has very truly remarked, 'a very powerful and majestic rhythmical movement and a sustained melody which are admirable, as for example—'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,' 'O Captain, my Captain,' 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed.' These, however, are exceptions. Generally speaking, Whitman's lines are deficient in melody. Music of a certain kind they certainly have; but they want the measured cadence, the flowing melody, that exquisite rhythmical charm which makes the words of the great poets take hold of the mind and live in the memory as the sweetest strain of a noble song. Nor can it be saxml:id that by adopting this peculiar mode of versification Whitman has secured any advantages superior to those afforded by the ordinary forms. That he has obtained a greater freedom may probably be admitted; but it is questionable whether it is not at the expense of effectiveness. To take but a single illustration. The thought of the following is admirable:—</p><p>'There was a child went forth every day:<br>And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;<br>And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part <br>of the day,<br>Or for many years, or stretching cycles of years<br>         .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .  <br>     The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt-marsh <br>and shore-mud;<br>These become part of that child who went forth every day, and <br>who now goes, and will always go forth every day.'</p><p>ut compare with it Wordsworth's treatment of the same theme:—</p><p>'The stars of mxml:idnight shall be dear<br>To her: and she shall lean her ear<br>In many a secret place,<br>Where rivulets dance their wayward round,<br>And beauty born of murmuring sound<br>Shall pass into her face.'</p><p>Whatever may be saxml:id in favour of Whitman's treatment, the advantages, so far as general effectiveness is concerned, are plainly with Wordsworth. The last two lines, besxml:ides having a fulness and suggestiveness about them quite equal to all that Whitman has saxml:id, or has attempted to say, have a music and a charm of expression on which the ear delights to dwell. Whitman's neglect of the art of expression is calculated, we think, to tell greatly against him. That he is capable of great things in this way we do not doubt. The poems referred to above, and others we could name, are a proof of the consummate work he might have done, had he been less impatient of restraint and more devoted to the perfecting of his skill in what is in reality one of the main sources of the poet's power. It must not be supposed, however, that Whitman is indifferent to the charms of art, or that, in his revolt against conventionalism, he has no rules or principles of his own. To those who imagine so we commend the perusal of what follows from the Preface of 1855:—</p><p>'The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity—nothing can make up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insousciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the road-sxml:ide, is the flawless triumph of art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey gull over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood-horse, or the tall leaning of some flowers on their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven, or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writings any elegance, or effect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. What I tell I tell precisely for what is. Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand by my sxml:ide and look in the mirror with me.'</p><p>In 'Children of Adam,' Whitman has sinned, we think, against good taste, common sense, and, in fact, as one of his critics has pointed out, against one of his own canons. True, he has probably violated no moral law, and has simply spoken of what nature permits. It is true also that according to Schiller, whatever nature permits, is permitted also to art. Still, there are some things on which men have agreed to be silent, and though we are by no means disposed to regard conventionality as the standard of morals, we cannot avoxml:id the conviction that by speaking of the sexual relations in the way in which he has, Whitman has violated a natural instinct of the human mind. That he is an immoral writer, as some of his critics have maintained, we do not believe. His fault is one of manner rather than of spirit, and has its origin in an error of judgement rather than in a wrong bias of the mind. His deepest spirit and highest aim are, it seems to us, religious; and nothing, we imagine, but a strong sense of duty could have made him withstand so patiently and persistently the fierce storm of invective and abuse which some of his poems have aroused against him.</p><p>Whitman's faults, however, are greatly outweighed by his merits. First we may notice that in spirit he is intensely American. In the poets of other lands he is evxml:idently well read; yet, he is an imitator of none. His manner, style, and spirit are entirely his own. Previous to him the poetry of American was, as has been justly observed, merely the poetry of apt pupils, with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. The poems of Bryant and Longfellow might have been written as easily on the banks of the Thames as on the banks of the Hudson. There is little in them that is distinctively American. Whitman's poems, on the other hand, are saturated through and through with the spirit of the New World. 'Starting from Paumanock,' 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,' 'A Song of Joys,' 'Song of the Broad Axe,' 'A Song for Occupations,' 'Pioneers! O Pioneers!' 'By Blue Ontario's Shore,' 'Drum-taps,' and 'Sea Drift,' it may be safely saxml:id, could not have been written elsewhere than on the American Continent, or by one whose spiritual life had not been reared among its people, and nourished by a life-long communion with its magnificent natural phenomena. Whitman is American also in another sense. He is thoroughly democratic. The Presxml:ident is no more to him than a mason, or woodsman, or western farmer. Any breath of a political aristocracy, of feudalism, or of caste, is not allowed to taint his pages. Their xml:ideas and institutions are entirely alien to his spirit. He could no more have written the xml:idylls of the King, or a play of Shakespeare than he could have written the Iliad. The doctrine which he preaches on every page is the greatness of the indivxml:idual soul. While Spencer writes 'to fashion a gentleman or nobleperson in virtuous and gentle discipline,' Whitman writes to build up a new and splendxml:id race of average men. As a poet of Democracy, as Democracy exists in the New World, he stands alone.</p><p>'The messages of great poets to each man and woman,' he has remarked, 'are, Come to us on equal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than you. What we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy.' Of his own poems, this is a marked feature. Their directness is unquestionable. They place the reader on a level with themselves, and make him feel that he is being addressed by one who is of the same flesh and blood as himself, by one whose thoughts and feelings are, or may be his own. And the reason is that, subjective as Whitman's poems are, and distinctively as they teach the doctrine of indivxml:idualism, they always rest on that which is universally human. Perhaps no other poet of the present has a larger vision of that 'great human heart by which we live,' or more persistently announces it. The 'self' of which he sings is not always his own indivxml:idual self; as frequently, if not more so, it is the universal self, that universal being of which each indivxml:idual is but a conscious manifestation. Of this any one can convince himself by a careful reading of the 'Song of Myself.' Take, for instance, the following lines:—</p><p>'I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning <br>and the end.<br>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br>There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now;'</p><p>or take the lines with which the song opens:—</p><p>'I celebrate myself, and sing of myself,<br>And what I assume you shall assume,<br>For every atom belongs to me as good as belongs to you;'</p><p>or these:—</p><p>'The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br>The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,<br>The old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps <br>by his wife;<br>And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br>And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>And of these one and all I weave the song of myself,'</p><p>This mysticism, indeed, forms the background of all Whitman's more important pieces, and is the key to their meaning. Without a clear apprehension of it it is impossible to understand the paradoxes in which his pages abound, or to reconcile his apparent contradictions. Were it not that we have Mr. Burroughs' assertion to the contrary, we should have attributed Whitman's mysticisms to a close study of Emerson. It seems, however, that before he published the first edition of the Leaves of Grass, Whitman had never read Emerson at all, and that he dxml:id not become acquainted with the Essay until the following summer. The similarity of their xml:ideas is remarkable, and may probably be taken as significant of the tendency of American thought.</p><p>Whitman is pre-eminently a poet of the modern world. No other has more thoroughly adopted the conclusions of science, or made a more splendxml:id and impressive use of them in his writings. Not unseldom they give a vastness and grandeur to his thought, which is well-nigh overwhelming. At the same time he is very far from being in any sense or degree a materialist. The supremacy of the spiritual he always loyally, and sometimes ostentatiously, recognises. Though almost Greek in his sympathy with nature, and notwithstanding the manner in which he has sung of man's physical constitution, the position which he assigns to the soul is always incomparably higher, as the following from his Preface of 1876 clearly shows:—</p><p>'Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a higher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too) the spiritual the religious—which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred-fold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the divine, and of the xml:ideal, through mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the objective worlds… To me the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendxml:id theology, and for ampler and diviner songs.'</p><p>Still, notwithstanding his modern tone of thought, and the democratic spirit which pervades his writings, the past is by no means disdained by Whitman. Past, present, and future, he holds, are not disjoined but joined. The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been. The present, he affirms, is but a stage in the eternal process of creative thought, and is what is through the past. At the same time, however, while admitting his indebtedness to the past, and claming kinship with it, he asserts also his independence, and claims to stand in his own place with his own day about him:—</p><p>'I conn'd old times,<br>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters:<br>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.<br>In the name of These States shall I scorn the antique?<br>Why these are the children of the antique to justify it.</p><p>Dead poets, philosophers, priests,<br>Martyrs, artists, investors, governments long since<br>Language-shapers on other shores,<br>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,<br>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left wafted <br>hither<br>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it)<br>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve more <br>than it deserves,<br>Regarding it all intensely a long while, then dismissing it,<br>I stand in my place with my own day here.'</p><p>We are warned, however, that our space is already exhausted, and can refer to but one other of the many features of Whitman's poetry. After pointing out that formerly he was consxml:idered the best poet who composed the most perfect work, or the one which was most complete in every respect, Sainte-Beuve has remarked that for us in the present the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's imagination and reflection; not he who has done the best, but he who suggests the most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, who leaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in your turn.' Judged by this standard Whitman deserves to take a place among the foremost. His works are preeminently suggestive. Any finished picture he seldom presents. His poems are rather suggestions, arousing the reader, and leading him on and on, till he feels the fresher air of a freer thought breathing around him, and sees spreading out before him the limitless and unknown.</p><p>'I but write one or two indicative words for the future,<br>I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.<br>I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a <br>casual look upon you, and then averts his face,<br>Leaving it to you to prove and define it,<br>Expecting the main things from you.'</p><p>To the religious spirit which breathes through Whitman's writings we have already referred; and our assertions on this point have been borne out by several of the passages we have cited for other purposes. Dxml:id our space permit, numerous other passages might be cited as bearing directly upon it. But as a last word, and as indicating with consxml:iderable fullness the scope and spirit of all that he has written, we transcribe the following:—</p><p>'And thou America,<br>For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its reality<br>For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.</p><p>'Thou, too, surroundest all,<br>Embracing, carrying, welcoming all, thou, too, by pathways broad and <br>new,<br>To the xml:ideal tendest.</p><p>'The measur'd faith of other lands, the grandeurs of the past,<br>Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,<br>Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all,<br>All eligible to all.</p><p>'All for immortality,<br>Love like the light silently wrapping all,<br>Nature's amelioration blessing all,<br>The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,<br>Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening.</p><p>'Give me, O God, to sing that thought<br>Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith,<br>In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not from us,<br>Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,<br>Health, peace, salvation, universal.</p><p>'Is it a dream?<br>Nay, but the lack of it the dream?<br>And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,<br>And all the world a dream.'</p><p>———</p><p>∗P. 183.</p><p>†Notes on Walt Whitman, pp. 15-16.</p><p>‡Studies in Literature, 1789–1877, p. 473.</p>",

	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S POETRY.</strong></p><p>What a whirl of 'new editions' we are in! Perhaps we must not complain—especially in those cases where the new edition is brought, by its price, within the reach of millions, instead of only thousands—if, when we turn them over, we find most disappointing omissions. Here is a new edition of the 'Poems of Walt Whitman' (published by Chatto and Windus), selected and edited by William Michael Rossetti. It is of convenient bulk, and excellent in paper and type and binding; and we must be thankful, even though there be nothing added to it from the volumes Walt Whitman has published since 1868. Mr. Rossetti is a most loyal and charitable interpreter of this most unmelodious and unrhythmical of poets; this strong, self-assured man, who 'entertains and professes respecting himself the grave conviction that he is the actual and prospective founder of a new poetic literature and a great one—a literature proportioned to the material vastness and the unmeasured destinies of America; he believes that the Columbus of the Continent, or the Washington of the States, was not more truly than himself in the future a founder and upbuilder of this America. Surely a sublime conviction, and expressed more than once in magnificent words—none more so than in the following poem'— 'Love of Comrades':—</p><p>Come, I will make the continent indissoluble;<br>I will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet <br>shone upon!<br>I will make divine magnetic lands,<br>With the love of comrades,<br>With the life-long love of comrades.<br>I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the<br> rivers of America, and along the shores of the great <br>lakes, and all over the prairies;<br>I will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each <br>other’s necks;<br>By the love of comrades,<br>By the manly love of comrades.<br>For you these, from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma <br>femme!<br>For you! for you, I am trilling these songs,<br>In the love of comrades,<br>In the high-towering love of comrades.</p><p>Mr. Rossetti believes that this idea of himself 'is true, if not absolutely, yet with a most genuine and substantial approximation.' He believes that Whitman 'is one of the huge, as yet mainly unrecognized, forces of our time; privileged to evoke, in a country hitherto still asking for its poet, a fresh, athletic, and American poetry, and predestined to be traced up to by generation after generation of believing and ardent—let us hope not servile—disciples. 'Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.' Shelley, who knew what he was talking about when poetry was the subject, has said it, and with a profundity of truth. Whitman seems in a peculiar degree marked out for 'legislation' of the kind referred to. His voice will one day be potential or magisterial wherever the English language is spoken—that is to say, in the four corners of the earth; and in his own American hemisphere, the uttermost avatars of democracy will confess him not more their announcer than their inspirer.'</p><p>Great is Walt Whitman, therefore, and W. M. Rossetti is his prophet. All the prophet says about his master may be well judged and true. We are glad we have no need to say it is or it is not. What we do say is that much beauty and much strength are in these poems; but the beauty is often very far to seek, and the strength is often provokingly tedious in its self-manifestations, and we heartily echo the hope of Mr. Rossetti that Whitman's 'disciples' in the future will not be 'servile.' The only poem—assuredly a beautiful one—in the whole collection which can be called rhythmical (and there are in it also some rhymes) is the one 'For the Death of Lincoln':</p><p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done.<br>The ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought<br>is won;<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and<br>daring;<br>But O heart! heart! heart!<br>Leave you not the little spot<br>Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.<br>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells!<br>Rise up! for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills:<br>For you bouquets and ribboned wreaths, for you the shores<br>a-crowding:<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces <br>turning.<br>O Captain! dear father!<br>This arm I push beneath you.<br>It is some dream that on the dock<br>You've fallen cold and dead!<br>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still:<br>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will.<br>But the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed<br>and done:<br>From fearful trip the victorship comes in with object won!<br>Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>But I, with silent trade,<br>Walk the spot my Captain lies,<br>Fallen cold and dead.</p><p>In this and in 'President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn' Whitman is really at his best as a poet; and in some of the 'Drum Taps,' which are the outcome of his brotherly and tender devotion to the wounded soldiers of the North during the great war, the pathos that breathes up through the great jagged lines and sentences is an almost startling revelation of the warmth and depth of his nature. We are not sure that the prose 'Preface to Leaves of Grass' is not greater than anything else he has written. It deserves to be read, and it can be read more easily than many of the poems.</p>",
