The book is an intertwining of the author's characteristic verse, alternated throughout with prose; and hence the name. In the Preface he says:</p><p><em>At the eleventh hour, under grave illness, I gather up the pieces of prose and poetry left over since publishing a while since my first and main volume, 'Leaves of Grass'—pieces, here, some new, some old—nearly all of them (somber as many are, making this almost Death's book) composed in by-gone atmospheres of perfect health—and preceded by the freshest collection, the little 'Two Rivulets,' now send them out, embodied in the present Melange, partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality—and then as chyle and nutriment to that moral, Indissoluble Union, equally representing All, and the mother of many coming Centennials.</p><p>For some reason—not explainable or definite to my own mind, yet secretly pleasing and satisfactory to it—I have not hesitated to embody in, and run through the volume, two altogether distinct veins or strata—Politics for one, and for the other, the pensive thought of Immortality. The pictures from the hospitals during the war I have also decided to include. Though they differ in character and composition from the rest of my pieces, yet I feel that they ought to go with them, and must do so.</em></p><p>At the outset comes this prelude, or sonata:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey.</p><p>For the Eternal Ocean bound,<br>These ripples, passing surges, streams of Death and Life,<br>Object and Subject, hurrying, whirling by,<br>The Real and Ideal.</p><p>Alternate ebb and flow the Days and Nights,<br>Strands of a Trio twining, Present, Future, Past.</p><p>In You, whoe'er you are, my book perusing,<br>In I myself—in all the World—these ripples flow,<br>All, all, toward the mystic Ocean tending.</p><p>(O yearnful waves! the kisses of your lips!<br>Your breast so broad, with open arms, O firm, expanded shore!)</p><p>And, on a well-known theme this second verse:</p><p>Or, from that Sea of Time,<br>Spray, blown by the wind—a double windrow-drift of<br> weeds and shells.<br>(O little shells, so curious-convolute! so limpid-cold and<br> voiceless!<br>Yet will you not, to the tympans of temples held,<br>Murmurs and echoes still bring up—Eternity's music, <br>faint and far<br>Wafted inland, sent from Atlantica's rim—strains for the <br>Soul of the Prairies.<br>Whisper'd reverberations—chords for the ear of the <br>West, joyously sounding<br>Your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable;)<br>Infinitesimals out of my life, and many a life,<br>(For not my life and years alone I give—all, all I give;)<br>These thoughts and Songs—waifs from the deep—here, <br>cast high and dry.<br>Washed on America's shores.</p><p>Then here is what Whitman terms his own poems:</p><p>Currents of starting a Continent new,<br>Overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid,<br>Fusion of ocean and land—tender and pensive waves,<br>(not safe and peaceful only—waves rous'd and ominous<br> too,<br>Out of the depths, the storm's abysms—Who knows <br>whence? Death's waves,<br>Raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tat-<br>ter'd sail.)</p><p>He says in a concluding part of the preface:</p><p><em>Without being a scientist, I have thoroughly adopted the conclusions of the great savans and experimentalists of our time and of the last hundred years, and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my verse for purposes beyond. Following the modern spirit, the real poems of the present, ever solidifying and expanding into the future, must vocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has invested man and the universe (all that is called creation), and must henceforth launch humanity into new orbits, consonant with that vastness, splendor, and reality (unknown to the old poems), like new systems of orbs, balanced upon themselves, revolving in limitless space, more subtle than the stars. Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at present wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery, and superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the past nor the themes of the past, will be revivified by this tremendous innovation, the kosmic spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion, be the background and underlying impetus, more or less visible, of all first-class songs.</p><p>Only (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry), joyfully accepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher fact, the eternal soul of man (of all else too), the spiritual, the religious—which it is to be the greatest office of t scientism, in my opinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities, and superstitions, and launch forth in renewed faith and scope a hundred fold. To me the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the Divine, and of the ideal, though mainly latent, are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the worlds of chemistry or anything in the objective world. To me, the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for a more splendid theology, and for ampler and diviner songs. No year, nor even century, will settle this. There is a phase of the real, lurking behind the real, which it is all for. There is also in the intellect of man, in time, far in prospective recesses, a judgment, a last appellate court, which will settle it.</em></p><p><em>EIDÓLONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eidólons.</p><p>Put in thy chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day—nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance-<br>song of all,<br>That of Eidólons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eidólons! Eidólons!</p><p>Ever the mutable!<br>Ever materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohereing!<br>Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,<br>Issuing Eidólons.</p><p>Lo! I or you!<br>Or woman, man, or State, known or unknown;<br>We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty build,<br>But really build Eidólons.</p><p>The ostent evanescent;<br>The substance of an artist's mood or savan's studies<br>long,<br>Or warrior's, martyr's, hero's toils,<br>To fashion his Eidólon.</p><p>Of every human life,<br>(The units gather'd, posted—not a thought, emotion,<br>deed, left out;)<br>The whole or large or small summ'd, added up,<br>In its Eidólon.</p><p>The old, old urge;<br>Based on the ancient pinnacles, lo! newer, higher pin-<br>nacles;<br>From science and the Modern still impell'd,<br>The old, old urge, Eidólons.</p><p>The present, now and here,<br>America's busy, teeming, intricate whirl,<br>Of aggregate and segregate, for only thence releasing,<br>To-day's Eidólons.</p><p>These, with the past,<br>Of vanish'd lands—of all the reigns of kings across the<br>sea,<br>Old conquerors, old campaigns, old sailors' voyages,<br>Joining Eidólons.</p><p>Densities, growth, façades,<br>Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees,<br>Far-born, far-dying, living long, to leave,<br>Eidólons everlasting.</p><p>Exalté, rapt, extatic,<br>The visible but their womb of birth,<br>Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape,<br>The mighty Earth-Eidólon.</p><p>All space, all time,<br>(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,<br>Swelling, collapsing, ending—serving their longer, shorter<br>use,)<br>Fill'd with Eidólons only.</p><p>The noiseless myriads!<br>The infinite oceans where the rivers empty!<br>The separate, countless free identities, like eyesight;<br>The true realities, Eidólons.</p><p>Not this the World,<br>Nor these the Universes—they the Universes,<br>Purport and end—ever the permanent life of life,<br>Eidólons, Eidólons.</p><p>Beyond thy lectures learn'd professor,<br>Beyond thy telescope or spectroscope observer keen—<br>beyond all mathematics,<br>Beyond the doctor's surgery, anatomy—beyond the chemist with his chem-<br>istry,<br>The entities of entities, Eidólons.</p><p>Unfix'd yet fix'd;<br>Ever shall be—ever have been and are,<br>Sweeping the present to the infinite future,<br>Eidólons, Eidólons, Eidólons.</p><p>The prophet and the bard,<br>Shall yet maintain themselves—in higher stages yet,<br>Shall mediate to the Modern, to Democracy—interpret<br>yet to them,<br>God, and Eidólons.</p><p>And thee, My Soul!<br>Joys, ceaseless exercises, exaltations!<br>Thy yearning amply fed at last, prepared to meet<br>Thy mates, Eidólons.</p><p>Thy Body permanent,<br>The Body lurking there within thy Body,<br>The only purport of the Form thou art—the real I my-<br>self,<br>An image, an Eidólon.</p><p>Thy very songs, not in thy songs;<br>No special strains to sing—none for itself;<br>But from the whole resulting, rising at last and floating,<br>A round, full-orb'd Eidólon.</p><p><strong>THOUGHTS FOR THE CENTENNIAL.</strong></p><p><em>I need not add to the multiform and swelling pæans, the self-laudation, the congratulatory voices, and the bringing to the front, and domination to-day of material wealth, products, goods, inventive smartness &c., (all very well may-be). But just for a change I feel like presenting a reflection or two like these:</p><p>1. Of most foreign countries, small or large, from the remotest times known, down to our own, each has contributed after its kind, directly or indirectly, at least one undying song to help vitalize and increase the valor, wisdom, and elegance of humanity, from the points of view attained by it up to date. The stupendous epics of India, the Holy Bible itself, the Homeric canticles, the Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador, the Inferno, Shakespeare's dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords, Burns's songs, Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in England, Victor Hugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various, yet integral, signs or landmarks (in certain respects the highest set up by the human mind and soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration, &c.), narrating in subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of history, and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate humanity, and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied civilizations. . . . Where is America's art-rendering, in anything like the spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic immortal monuments?</p><p>2. So far, in America, our democratic society (estimating its various strata, in the mass, as one), possesses nothing—nor have we contributed any characteristic music, the finest tie of nationality—to make up for that glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional, artistic, indefinable, indescribably beautiful charm and hold which fused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together in their wonderful interpretation, in Europe and Asia, of love, belief and loyalty, running one way like a living weft—and picturesque responsibility, duty and blessedness, running like a warp the other way. (In the Southern States, under slavery, much of the same.) . . In coincidence, and as things now exist in the States, what is more terrible, more alarming than the total want of any such fusion and mutuality of love, belief and rapport of interest, between the comparatively few successful rich and the great masses of the unsuccessful, the poor? . . As a mixed political and social question, is not this full of dark significance? Is it not worth considering as a problem and puzzle in our democracy--an indispensable want to be supplied?</p></em><p>Whitman gives his own portrait from life in the book—a large, bending, gray-haired man, 'looking at you'—and the picture is illustrated by the following verse:</p><p>Out from behind this bending rough-cut Mask,<br>(All straighter, liker Masks rejected—this preferr'd,)<br>This common curtain of the face, contain'd in me for <br>me, in you for you, in each for each,<br>(Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears—O heaven!<br>The passionate, teeming plays this curtain hid!)<br>The glaze of God's serenest, purest sky,<br>This film of Satan's seething pit,<br>This heart's geography's map—this limitless small conti-<br>nent—this soundless sea,<br>Out from the convolutions of this globe,<br>This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon—than <br>Jupiter, Venus, Mars;<br>This condensation of the Universe—(nay, here the only <br>Universe,<br>Here the Idea—all in this mystic handful wrapt;)<br>These burin'd eyes, flashing to you, to pass to future <br>time,<br>To launch and spin through space revolving, sideling— <br>from these to emanate,<br>To You, who'er you are—a Look.</p><p><strong>FREEDOM.</strong></p><p><em>It is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand freedom, but I sometimes think I have not yet met one person who rightly understands it. . . . The whole universe is absolute law. Freedom only opens entire activity and license under the law. To the degraded or undeveloped—and even to too many others—the thought of freedom is a thought of escaping from law—which, of course, is impossible.</p><p>More precious than all worldly riches is Freedom—freedom from the painful constipation and poor narrowness of ecclesiasticism; freedom in manners, habiliments, furniture, from the silliness and tyranny of local fashions—entire freedom from party rings and mere conventions in politics—and, better than all, a general freedom of one's self from the tyrannic domination of vices, habits, appetites, under which nearly every man of us (often the greatest bawler for freedom) is enslaved.</p><p>Can we attain such enfranchisement—the true democracy and the hight of it? While we are from birth to death subjects of irresistible law, inclosing every movement and minute, we yet escape by a paradox, into true free will. Strange as it may seem, we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of, and implicit obedience to law. Great—unspeakably great—is the will! the free soul of man! At its greatest, understand and obeying the laws, it can then, and then only, maintain true liberty . . . . . For there is to the highest, that law as absolute as any—more absolute than any—the law of liberty. The shallow, as intimated, consider liberty a release from all law, from every constraint. The wise seee in it, on the contrary, the potent law of laws, namely, the fusion and combination of the conscious will, or partial individual law, with those universal, eternal, unconscious ones, which run through all time, pervade history, prove immortality, give moral purpose to entire objective world, and the last dignity to human life.</em></p><p><em>TO A LOCOMOTIVE IN WINTER.</em><br>Thee for my recitative!<br>Thee in the driving storm even as now—the snow—the <br>Winter-day declining;<br>Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and <br>thy beat convulsive;<br>Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel;<br>Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, <br>gyrating, shuttling at thy sides;<br>Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar—now tapering in the distance;<br>Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front;<br>Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple;<br>The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy <br>smoke-stack;<br>Thy knitted frame—thy springs and valves—the tremu-<br>lous twinkle of thy wheels;<br>Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,<br>Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily <br>careering;<br>Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse<br> of the continent!<br>For once, come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even <br>as here I see thee,<br>With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling <br>snow;<br>By day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes,<br>By night, thy silent signal lamps to swing.</p><p>Fierce-throated beauty!<br>Roll through my chant with all thy lawless music! thy <br>swinging lamps at night;<br>Thy piercing, madly-whistled laughter! thy echoes, rous-<br>ing all!</p><p>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;<br>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano <br>thine,)<br>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,<br>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide—across the lakes,<br>To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.</p><p><strong>NEW POETRY—PROSE GRANDER THAN VERSE.</strong></p><p><em>In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . . In my opinion, I say, while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time played great and fitting parts, that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably rendered in rhyming verse—that there have been very illustrious poets, whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloped—and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age—it is, not withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression, present or future it palpably fails, and must fail to serve. The muse of the prairies, and the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully enlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people, with the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong to them, body and soul—to the general globe, and all its relations in astronomy, as the savans portray them to us—to the modern, the busy nineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different), with steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder presses—to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth—to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or on shipboard, or on lakes and rivers—resumes that other medium of expression, more flexible, more eligible—soars to the freer, vast, diviner heaven of prose.</em></p><p>The volume, in its 350 pages, comprises, besides the 'Two Rivulets,' from which the foregoing extracts are taken, the prose essay, 'Democratic Vistas,' and the poetical pieces already published under the same name of 'Passage to India.' Quite a large part of the book is occupied with Whitman's 'Memoranda During the War,' in the army hospitals, or down at the front, being given verbatim from the original notes of the time, 'blotch'd here and there with more than one blood stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty or defeat or of action, or of getting ready for it, or a march.' He says, as he introduces these little note-book mementoes of the war:</p><p><em>Vivid as life they recall and identify the long hospital wards, with their myriad-varied scenes of day or night; the graphic incidents of field or camp; the night before the battle with many solemn yet cool preparations; the changeful exaltations and depressions of those four years, North and South; the convulsive memories (left but a word, a broken sentence serve to recall them); the clews already quite vanished, like some old dream, and yet the list significant enough to soldiers; the scrawled, worn slips of paper that came up by bushels from the Southern prisons, Salisbury or Andersonville, by the hands of exchanged prisoners; the clank of crutches on the pavements or floors of Washington, or up and down the stairs of Paymasters' offices; the grand review of home-bound veterans at the close of the war, cheerily marching day after day by the President's bouse, one brigade succeeding another until it seemed as if they would never end; the strange squads of Southern deserters (escapees, I called them); that little génre group, unrock'd amid the mighty whirl, I remember passing in a hospital corner, of a dying Irish boy, a Catholic priest, and an impoverished altar; four years compressing centuries of native passion, first-class pictures, tempests of life and death, an inexhaustible mine for the histories, drama, romance, and even philosophy of centuries to come; indeed, the vertebra of poetry and art (or personal character too) for all future America (far more grand, in my opinion, to the hands capable of it, than Homer's siege of Tory or the French wars of Shakespeare); and looking over all, in my remembrance, the tall form of President Lincoln, with his face of deep-cut lines, with the large, kind, canny eyes, the complexion of dark brown, and the tinge of weird melancholy saturating all.</p><p>More and more, in my recollections of that period, and through its varied, multitudinous oceans and murky whirls, appear the central resolution and sternness of the bulk or the average American people, animated in soul by a definite purpose, though sweeping and fluid as some great storm—the common people, emblemized in thousands of specimens of first-class heroism, steadily accumulating, (nor regiment, no company, hardly a file of men, North or South, the last three years, without such first-class specimens.)</p><p>I know not how it may have been, or may be, to others—to me the main interest of the war, I found (and still, on recollection, find), in those specimens, and in the ambulance, the hospital, and even the dead on the field. To me, the points illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities of these States, in the two or three millions of Americans young and middle-aged men, North and South, embodied in armies--and especially the one-third or one-fourth of their number, stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest—were of more significance even than the political interests involved.</em></p><p>We also add a few hitherto unpublished forthcoming pieces from 'Leaves of Grass.' On the new title page of that volume appears the following verse, signed by Whitman's autograph:</p><p>Come, said my Soul,<br>Such verses for my Body let us write (for we are one),<br>That should I after death invisibly return,<br>Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,<br>There to some group of mates, the chants resuming<br>(Tallying Earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves),<br>Ever with pleased smile I may keep on,<br>Ever and ever yet the verses owing—as, first-I here and <br>now,<br>Singing for Soul and Body, set to them my name.</p><p><em>AFTER AN INTERVAL.<br>(Nov. 22, 1875, midnight—Saturn and Mars in conjunction.)</em><br>After an interval, reading, here in the midnight,<br>With the great stars looking on—all the stars of Orion <br>looking,<br>And the silent Pleiades—and the duo looking of Saturn <br>and ruddy Mars;<br>Pondering, reading my own songs, after a long interval <br>(sorrow and death familiar now),<br>Ere closing the book, what pride! what joy! to find them,<br>Standing so well the test of death and night!<br>And the duo of Saturn and Mars!</p><p><em>WHEN THE FULL-GROWN POET CAME.</em><br>When the full-grown poet came,<br>Out spake pleas'd Nature (the round impassive Globe, <br>with all its shows of day and night), saying, He is <br>mine;<br>But out spake too the Soul of Man, proud, jealous and un-<br>reconciled, Nay, he is mine alone;<br>—Then the full-grown Poet stood between the two, and <br>took each by the hand,<br>And to-day and ever so stands, as blender, uniter, tightly <br>holding hands,<br>Which he will never release until he reconciles the two,<br>And wholly and joyously blends them.</p><p><em>THE BEAUTY OF THE SHIP.</em><br>When, staunchly entering port,<br>After long ventures, hauling up, worn and old,<br>Better'd by sea and wind, torn by many a fight,<br>With the original sails all gone, replaced, or mended,<br>I only saw, at last the beauty of the ship.</p><p>The following are extracts from 'Two Rivulets:'</p><p><em>A SONG BY THE POTOMAC.</em><br>By broad Potomac's shore—again, old tongue!<br>(Still uttering—still ejaculating—canst never cease this <br>babble?)<br>Again, old heart so gay—again to you, your sense, the <br>full flush Spring returning;<br>Again the freshness and the odors—again Virginia's Sum-<br>mer sky, peliucid blue and silver<br>Again the forenoon purple of the hills,<br>Again the deathbed grass, so noiseless, soft and green,<br>Again the blood-red roses blooming.</p><p>Perfume this book of mine, O blood-red roses!<br>Lave subtly with your waters every line, Potomac!<br>Give me of you, O Spring, before I close, to put between <br>its pages!<br>O foresoon purple of the hills, before I close, of you!<br>O smiling earth—O Summer sun, give me of you!<br>O deathless grass, of you!</p><p><em>SHIP OF DEMOCRACY.</em><br>Sail—sail thy best, ship of Democracy!<br>Of value is they freight—'tis not the Present only,<br>The past is also stored in thee!<br>Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone—not of <br>thy western continent alone;<br>Earth's resume entire floats on thy keel, O ship—is<br> steadied by thy spars;<br>With thee Time voyages in trust—the antecedent nations <br>sink or swim with thee;<br>With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, <br>wars, thou bear'st the other continents;<br>Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port <br>triumphant;<br>—Steer, steer with good strong band and wary eye, O <br>helmsman—thou carryest great companions,<br>Venerable, priestly Asia sails this day with thee,<br>And royal, feudal Europe sails with thee.</p>",

	"title": "New Work by Walt. Whitman.",
	"body": "<p><strong>NEW WORK BY WALT. WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p><p>NEW YORK, FEB. 23.</p><p>The only American prophet to my knowledge who enjoys a fame in England not accorded him in his own country is the prophet of the new Democratic school of poetry, Walt. Whitman. Although his earlier publications attracted here a certain degree of attention in literary circles, and aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among some of the 'plain people,' whose singer he especially desired to be called, it can hardly be said that his claims to the rank of poet were seriously considered in America until they had been discussed by Mr. W. M. Rosetti [sic], Mr. Robert Buchanan, and other authorities in London. The dubious position which he won here by their help he has not been able to hold. To-day he probably has ten admirers and readers abroad for every one that he has at home. There is a rough honesty, a wild sort of sweetness in the strange man's character, an evident genuineness in his eccentricities, both personal and literary, which have won for him general respect and even a great deal of popular affection, while the estimate of his poetical powers, accepted a few years ago, has been steadily declining. He is no longer one of the curiosities of the Republic; and while the stories of his extreme poverty and suffering which recently obtained circulation are, I am glad to say, untrue, he has fallen into obscurity, if not into positive neglect, and apparently into a mood of sorrow. The impression which one gathers from a few sheets of his forthcoming volume is at any rate rather a melancholy one. He calls the new book 'Two Rivulets,' for it contains a stream of prose and a stream of verse:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey;</p><p>And he sends it out 'partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality, and then as chyle and nutriment of that moral and indissoluble union, equally representing all, and the mother of many coming centennials.' Nor is it only in the form of the pieces composing the book that he follows a double line. There are two distinct veins of thought-Politics and Immortality. The rivulets are rude, brawling streams, no doubt, but they keep within much narrower bounds than the turbulent streams of his earlier poems. He has no respect for artificial barriers to poetic inspiration:</p><p><em>In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . . In my opinion, I say, while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time played great and fitting parts, that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably rendered in rhyming verse—that there have been very illustrious poets, whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloped—and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age—it is, not withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression, present or future it palpably fails, and must fail to serve. The muse of the prairies, and the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully enlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people, with the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong to them, body and soul—to the general globe, and all its relations in astronomy, as the savans portray them to us—to the modern, the busy nineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different), with steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder presses—to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth—to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or on shipboard, or on lakes and rivers—resumes that other medium of expression, more flexible, more eligible—soars to the freer, vast, diviner heaven of prose.</em></p><p>But there is much less than his olden extravagance in this poem, characteristic as it nevertheless is:</p><p><em>EIDÓLONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eidólons.</p><p>Put in they chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day—nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance-<br>song of all,<br>That of Eidólons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eidólons!

(Including Memoranda of the War.) Altogether 350 pages. $5.</p><p>Those who have heard that Walt Whitman has become either physically or mentally broken down, or has retired from the contest, or has faltered even for a moment in his plans, will only need to read a very few pages of these volumes, to decide that they have been misinformed. He is here yet, and his style is more daring, more egotistical, more abrupt and involved than ever; he soars more and sings less than ever.</p><p>'Leaves of Grass' remains pretty much in the same shape as of yore. The other volume, 'Two Rivulets,' may be briefly described as a strange alternation of prose and verse, politics and spiritualism. It includes 'Memoranda of the War.'</p><p>But there is nothing in all Walt Whitman's works, new or old, half so marvelous, or half so great a 'curiosity of literature' as the steady persistence of the author amid the nearly unanimous opposition (in this country at least) of orthodox criticism.</p><p>In this connection, among the items we glean from 'interviewers' and others, it is said, we believe authentically, that Whitman has never yet found (and has not to-day) a publisher for his books, but has always printed them himself, and sold them by agents—that they have a little more than paid their own expenses—that there have been six editions or growths—the magazines scornfully refuse his MSS.—that his heart and spirits are just as cheerful as ever—that he has been ill from paralysis and without income or employment for the last three years (during which also his New York agents have shamelessly embezzled the proceeds of his sales, 'which, fortunately,' he dryly remarked to the interviewer, who gives us this item, 'have not been large')—and that he is now poor, though not in want.</p><p>It may interest some to know that the volumes of this 1876 edition, (a very limited one, less than 150 sets in all,) have each the author's physical touch and magnetism. Every book has been handled by him, contains his signature, and the photograph and pictures put in by his own hands. The newer parts were printed at this office.</p><p>Whitman, (P.O. address permanently here in Camden, New Jersey,) sells these books exclusively himself.</p><p>Altogether, as he has come through, and as he holds out to-day, he fully illustrates in himself that</p><p><em>'Splendid and savage race of old men'</em></p><p>called for in these pages, in passionate demand for America.</p>",

	"body": "<p><strong>Walt Whitman, the American Poet.</strong></p><p>———</p><p>Postes nascitur non fit , if true as applied to the individual, ought on the same principle to be true as applied to peoples, and yet, as a matter of fact, there have been but two really great leading nations in poetry—Greece and Great Britain—and this is perhaps the more remarkable, because, beyond the likeness of both being islanders and born with freedom in their souls as an instinct, their general tone of thought and feeling, and modes of expressing them, were, and are, as dissimilar as could well be between two branches of the same distinctive race of men.</p><p>But what is perhaps more remarkable, considering that [an] Anglo-Saxon, when turning colonist, not only takes all his household gods with him into his 'fresh fields and pastures new,' but also his old stereotyped habits and manners, and that therefore, proportionally to the numbers comprised in his 'exodus' to a strange land, would also spring forth in due season poet or poets, as freely in quantity and as great in quality as in the 'old land,' is the fact that the great Anglo-Saxon 'Empire'—in all but name—of the United States has never yet produced one really great poet, although, living as its more energetic sons did, and still do, amidst a newer and far grander variety of wilderness of lake, plain, river, and forest scenery, than their forefathers of the old world did-the natural idea would be that the vastness and freshness of such 'untamed nature' would have even educed a yet loftier strain of song, if possible, than their ancient sires of the past, and their old world brethren of the present sang or sing, and yet, instead of this, their highest and their best are barely above mediocrity, or certainly not more than equal to our second-rate English bards!</p><p>We suppose by their own valuation at least that 'Longfellow' is their best, and yet, when he is at his best, he is not purely American, either in scenery or thoughts, so that their 'national poet' not only lacks the power of expression of his mightier European brethren, but his best writings are also deficient in more 'local colouring,' and so much so that he might almost as well have written most of his works in New South Wales as in New York, as far as mere 'tone' goes, only that in that case our Yankee cousins would not have been able to exclaim, like the great sartorial house of Moses and Sons 'we keep our own poet on the premises!'</p><p>Poietikos, the maker! What a distinctive and expressive name, and yet how few real 'makers' are there in the world—plenty of copyists—plenty of mere rhymsters—plenty of authors (?) [sic] with a 'fatal facility' for that 'easy writing' which, as the wit said, 'was such curst hard reading'—but of the real great ones who can boldly and truthfully say, 'Alone I did it!' How few, how, for the sake of the whole world, lamentably few there be of them, whose heaven-born gift of seeing farther and clearer into the higher spiritual life, around and about us enables them to pierce the mystery and to seize the esoteric meaning of some real truth, and with utterances of genius, translate it into the everyday language of everyday life, and crystallize it as it were, imperishably for all time, to help light up through all the future the lives of the children of men, and show them, as it were, though even as 'in a glass darkly' some faint unearthly radiance reflected from the far off dim seen, lustrous splendours of eternity—some shadowy gleam of</p><p>'The light that never was on land or sea,<br>The poet's inspiration and his dream.'</p><p>Truth said the ancient is but of one face, yet hath many features; and so real poetry differs much in its utterance, flowing 'sweet as the living waters of Pharpar and Abana,' from the one source—mighty and fierce as the thunder falls of Niagara from the other or salt and bitter as the lonely lifeless wave of the Dead Sea of Sodom from a third—and yet all equally 'true,' and doing the work of truth sooner or later, for truth, like wisdom, is 'justified of her children.'</p><p>'Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?' Can a real poet come out of 'dollar land?' Can Brother Jonathan prove that he has really 'raised' a genuine live poet of his own breed and feed, 'clear grit?' and in whose speech speaks unmistakeably the 'voice of many waters,' and in whose breath whispers clearly what the wild winds of the lonely desert, heard in the savage wilds of pathless mountains, and bore secretly and safely through boundless forests, and gave unchanged unto him, to be translated truly from its great mother (nature) tongue, by the mouth of her anointed priest for the teaching of all her children, and for the awakening of new thoughts in the dwellers of older continents and newer colonies.</p><p>Whether America herself believes, or does not believe, that she has such a son in Walt Whitman, his English confreres, or at any rate very many of them, do believe that however she may elect to 'leave him to his fate' with cold indifference as to his present fortunes, and doubt as to his future fame, yet they cordially recognize him as one of the 'deathless band,' and as having not only the right to food here but also to fame hereafter, and as there has been some little controversy about him lately on both sides the Atlantic, and as it is possible that none of his works may have fallen into the hands of some of our readers for them to judge either of his merits or demerits, we subjoin a few extracts as well from his own writings as also from what is said and written about him, both by the American and English Press-by statements in which latter it will be seen that whether he ever gains the distinction in the first line or not, he seems to stand a 'bad' chance of realising the force and suffering from the ill effects of being driven to practise the second in the well-known couplet—</p><p>'Seven Grecian cities claimed great Homer dead,<br>Through which, in vain, he living begged his bread.'</p><p>Let us, however, hope that the moderns will be both more quickly appreciative and actively charitable than the ancients were, and that bread will at least be found him during the remainder of his mortal life, even though fame may not be given to immortalize him after death.</p><p>The apophthegm in physic, 'when doctors differ who shall decide?' is also partly applicable to art and taste, and as everything new must have a beginning, the 'new beginners' in a new faith, or a new interpretation of art, generally meet with rather a 'bad time' of it from the majority whose 'faith' or 'fancy' they seek to change or supplant, and as Walt Whitman is as 'advanced' in some of his ideas about poetry, as Herr Wagner is in his about music, there has been nearly as great a controversy between his few admirers and his many detractors, as to whether his poetry is in any sense poetry at all, and whether it will 'live' or not, as there was, and is, about the Herr's 'music of the future' as being the possible supplanter , in time, of the melody of the present.</p><p>Whether his own countrymen have less 'taste' or more judgment, or whether it is on the principle 'that a prophet is never honoured in his own country,' one thing is certain, that he meets with much more admiration, and, we suppose also, genuine appreciation from the British public and republic of letters, than he does from his own republic, and the citizens thereof, dwellers though they be in the same tents with him, and considering how anxious the Americans are to be thought the equals (at least) of the old world in all matter of a[e]sthetics, as well as superiors in enterprise and general intelligence, it is rather surprising that they do not at once accept the dictum of the literary few in England (whose opinion gives a sort of 'mint stamp') that they really have a swan where they have hitherto seen only a goose, and (like a shrewd trader when he finds a customer sees a value in his goods more than he dreamt of) at once declare that not only is it a veritable swan, but moreover 'a swan amongst swans,' and proclaim at once, loud-tongued to the old world, that what the 'unregenerate' in taste call 'roughness' in him is really unhewn rugged strength, the marble block with the Apollo Belvidere strongly fashioned forth in it, but the smoother chiseling left contemptuously untouched, and the 'obscurity of thought and expression' merely the mannerism of one 'whose faith is large in time,' and who, knowing his work will live, leaves the fuller interpretation of it to the stronger and more advanced minds of the future.</p><p>One of his own countrymen (a press correspondent) thus writes of him—</p><p>The only American prophet to my knowledge who enjoys a fame in England not accorded him in his own country is the prophet of the new Democratic school of poetry, Walt. Whitman. Although his earlier publications attracted here a certain degree of attention in literary circles, and aroused a great deal of enthusiasm among some of the 'plain people,' whose singer he especially desired to be called, it can hardly be said that his claims to the rank of poet were seriously considered in America until they had been discussed by Mr. W. M. Rosetti [sic], Mr. Robert Buchanan, and other authorities in London. The dubious position which he won here by their help he has not been able to hold. To-day he probably has ten admirers and readers abroad for every one that he has at home. There is a rough honesty, a wild sort of sweetness in the strange man's character, an evident genuineness in his eccentricities, both personal and literary, which have won for him general respect and even a great deal of popular affection, while the estimate of his poetical powers, accepted a few years ago, has been steadily declining. He is no longer one of the curiosities of the Republic; and while the stories of his extreme poverty and suffering which recently obtained circulation are, I am glad to say, untrue, he has fallen into obscurity, if not into positive neglect, and apparently into a mood of sorrow. The impression which one gathers from a few sheets of his forthcoming volume is at any rate rather a melancholy one. He calls the new book 'Two Rivulets,' for it contains a stream of prose and a stream of verse:</p><p>Two Rivulets side by side,<br>Two blended, parallel, strolling tides,<br>Companions, travelers, gossiping as they journey;</p><p>and he sends it out 'partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the first Centennial of our New World Nationality, and then as chyle and nutriment of that moral and indissoluble union, equally representing all, and the mother of many coming centennials.' Nor is it only in the form of the pieces composing the book that he follows a double line. There are two distinct veins of thought-Politics and Immortality. The rivulets are rude, brawling streams, no doubt, but they keep within much narrower bounds than the turbulent streams of his earlier poems. He has no respect for artificial barriers to poetic inspiration:—</p><p><em>'In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, etc., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the mediums for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself and anyhow,) the truest and greatest poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be expressed in arbitrary and rhyming meter, any more than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. . . . In my opinion, I say, while admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time played great and fitting parts, that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably rendered in rhyming verse—that there have been very illustrious poets, whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately enveloped—and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age—it is, not withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression, present or future it palpably fails, and must fail to serve. The muse of the prairies, and the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully enlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people, with the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong to them, body and soul—to the general globe, and all its relations in astronomy, as the savans portray them to us—to the modern, the busy nineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different), with steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder presses—to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth—to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or on shipboard, or on lakes and rivers—resumes that other medium of expression, more flexible, more eligible—soars to the freer, vast, diviner heaven of prose.'</em></p><p>There is both force and truth in a good deal of what he then says—for even the poets of all schools admit that rhyme is merely the 'colour to the drawing,' and that blank verse is the experimentum crucis by which to try all real poetry—in fact, as our readers are aware, rhyme only came into use with the early troubadours, who doubtless found that in an age when 'books were not,' and their songs were 'as household words,' that the 'jingle' at the end acted as a sort of mental fishhook, and so enabled them to be more easily remembered. Tho two oldest and grandest poems in the world, perhaps—the sacred one of 'Job,' and the secular one of the 'Iliad,' are in blank verse, or, to speak more correctly, in rhythmical prose, and to rhyme them is not only to ruin them, but is also, more or less, a desecration, even despite Pope's splendid attempt of the one, and because of the miserable 'metrical failures' with the other. Also, Whitman is undoubtedly right in this, that inasmuch as 'the proper study of mankind is man,' so the present should interpret the present, and that there is scope in each age for a great poet to interpret the voice of that special age, and that the 'wonders of steam and telegraphy' have as much claim on us, who have helped their Herculean birth, and are profiting by the labours of their giant man-hood, and have as much right to be 'sung greatly of' by a great singer, as even the mighty men and things of the mighty past, which yet, after all (however 'distance may lend enchantment to the view,' and however grandly they may loom out of the depths of the ancient ages, and seem magnified in the dim mists of antiquity,) were not mightier to the men of their day—nor cannot be really mightier to the men of this—than their own mighty present is, with its boundless material power in its thunder throbs of chained and harnessed lightning, and its spiritual strength in the awakening and widening thrills of higher thought and larger life which pulse profoundly through the great living heart of humanity, with a holier purpose, a stronger will, and a more universal charity than the past ever knew or dreamt of, which even the present yet scarcely foresees the outcome of, and which perchance, the future will fully realise, into the brotherhood of all mankind, and the loving practice of 'peace and goodwill on Earth unto all men!'</p><p.'Yes, my brethren, oh! be hopeful, for the storm precedes <br>the shine,<br>Thro' the clouds of ignorance roll we-on today-dawns more <br>divine.'</p><p>Whitman practises what he preaches by 'singing of steam' in his 'To a Locomotive in Winter,' thus—</p><p>Thee for my recitative!<br>Thee in the driving storm—even as now—the Winter-day <br>declining;<br>Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy<br> beat convulsive;<br>Thy black cylindric body, golden brass and silvery steel;<br>Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, <br>gyrating, shuttling at thy sides;<br>Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar—now tapering in <br>the distance;<br>Thy great protruding head-light fix'd in front;<br>Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate<br> purple;<br>The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke- <br>stack;<br>Thy knitted frame—thy springs and valves—the tremulous <br>twinkle of thy wheels;<br>Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,<br>Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily <br>careering;<br>Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of <br>the continent!<br>For once, come serve the Muse and merge in verse, even as <br>here I see thee,<br>With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow;<br>Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;<br>(No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)<br>Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,<br>Launch'd o'er the prairies wide—across the lakes,<br>To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.</p><p>A very characteristic poem of his, though much less 'extravagant,' is</p><p><em>EIDÓLONS.</em><br>I met a Seer,<br>Passing the hues and objects of the world,<br>The fields of art and learning, pleasure, sense,<br>To glean Eidólons.</p><p>Put in they chants, said he,<br>No more the puzzling hour, nor day—nor segments, parts,<br>put in,<br>Put first before the rest, as light for all, and entrance- <br>song of all,<br>That of Eidólons.</p><p>Ever the dim beginning;<br>Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle;<br>Ever the summit, and the merge at last, (to surely start<br>again,)<br>Eidólons!

Whether he will 'live,' time, which tries all things, must be the one proof of—but in any case he is neither a mere ready-rhymester nor a pleasing plagiarist, and in this age of shame and shoddy, it is refreshing to come across a bit of real nature, even though rough and rugged, and to feel and believe that instead of the ordinary modern 'polished Pontius Pilate' of literature asking 'what is truth?' with more scorn even than pity in the sad enquiry, you are reading the beliefs of a man who believes he sees truth, and manfully believes in uttering it as he sees and hears it, and also believes he is an appointed utterer!</p><p>In conclusion, and as showing the sentiment of some of his admirers in England, we subjoin his brother poet, Robert Buchanan's, letter, with the sentiment and suggestion of which we heartily sympathise, and trust that it will not appeal in vain to all the liberal-handed and large-hearted of both Walt-Whitman's countrymen and our own.:-</p>",

	"title": "Walt Whitman's New Book",
	"body": "<p><strong>WALT WHITMAN'S NEW BOOK.</strong></p><p><em>Two Rivulets</em> By Walt Whitman. (Camden, 1876.)</p><p>THE new volume by Walt Whitman will not be found to contain any very important illustrations of his theory of poetic composition, or any very original ethical statements, but it throws a good deal of light upon his personal character, and embraces much individual and incidental matter which is of very high interest. In the first place, we fancy that it will be difficult for any sincere critic, desirous of judging without prejudice on either side, to read the 'Memoranda during the War' without acknowledging that the author is personally brave and self-sacrificing, and the preface to the whole without admitting that his aims are pure and his belief in his own mission genuine. It has become difficult to speak of Whitman without passion. His opponents expend upon him every term of obloquy, private and public, which their repertory contains; his more extreme admirers claim for him all the respect reserved, long after their deaths, for the founders of successful religions. Between the class that calls Whitman an immoral charlatan bent on the corruption of youth, and the class that accounts him an inspired prophet, sent, among other iconoclastic missions, to abolish the practice of verse, there lies a great gulf. One would like to ask if it be not permitted that one should hold, provisionally, an intermediate position, and consider him a pure man of excellent intentions, to whom certain primitive truths with regard to human life have presented themselves with great vividness, and who has chosen to present them to us in semi-rhythmic, rhetorical language, which rises occasionally, in fervent moments, to a kind of inarticulate poetry, and falls at others into something very inchoate and formless. A wise admirer might even say that the book called Leaves of Grass was intended to give a section, as it were, of the ordinary daily life of a normal man, and therefore properly falls, as every life does, occasionally into shapeless passages of mere commonplace or worse, Poetry proper being always occupied with the rapid and ecstatic moments of life, whether in sorrow or pleasure. The folly of refusing to admit any beauty in Whitman's work seems obvious in the face of a dozen such passages as the famous 'Burial Hymn,' or the picturesque parts of the rhapsody called 'Walt Whitman;' the danger of acknowledging him with too little reserve is best realised if one conceives the dread possibility of the arising of a school of imitators of his tuneless recitative.</p><p>The book before us contains all the small miscellaneous writings of Whitman now collected for the first time. In verse (or recitative) we have the 'Passage to India,' which appeared in 1872 sic, and 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free,' dating from the same year. The prose book called Democratic Vistas was printed in 1871, and all, therefore, which we have to consider here is the opening cluster of rhythmical pieces called 'Two Rivulets,' the 'Centennial Songs,' and the prose 'Memoranda during the War,' all which are now published for the first time. Of the brief but varied contents of the first of these, the most remarkable is a dramatic soliloquy put into the mouth of the dying Columbus, who, sick to death with grief and disappointment, but indomitable still, paces the shores of Jamaica and utters his piteous and majestic lament:—</p><p>'I am too full of woe!<br>Haply I may not live another day;<br>I cannot rest, O God,I cannot eat<br>Or drink or sleep, till I put forth myself,<br>My prayer, once more to Thee,<br>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune<br>With Thee, report myself once more with Thee.'</p><p>The division into lines is our own, the sequence of no words being altered, and it will be seen how naturally the slow march falls into scarcely irregular blank verse. This piece, which might take a place among the death-songs of 'A Passage to India' may be contrasted with 'The Ox-Tamer,' a very fine study of life in the West, where</p><p>'In a far-away northern county, in the placid, pas-<br>toral region,<br>Lives my farmer-friend, the theme of my recitative, <br>a famous Tamer of Oxen.'</p><p>This is a worthy pendent to the description of the bridal of the Trapper, and the similar passages of marvellous picturesque directness to be found in Leaves of Grass. An address 'To a Locomotive in Winter' is certainly the most vivid and imaginative view of an apparently hopeless subject yet achieved. 'From that Sea of Time' presents a remarkably beautiful idea of the poet holding to his ear, one after another, the limpid and voiceless shells blown up on the shore of history, and hopelessly striving to gain from their murmurs some tidings of the sea of Time from whence they come, a thought kindred to the famous fancies of Wordsworth and of Landor. There is not much else in the section which possesses special merit, and there is one piece, called 'Eidolons,' which contains almost every vicious habit of style which Whitman has ever adopted, and which is quite enough, alone, to make the general objection to his writings plausible.</p><p>Of the four 'Centennial Songs,' one, 'The Song of the Redwood Tree,' has something primitive or Vedic in the strength of imagination which links in it in one great chorus the vast forces of nature, rain and snow and the wild winds, colossal trees, and huge mountains, and the serene skies above them all. This heroic chant is full of an arrogance appropriate to the occasion, and is far above any perfunctory trickle of complimentary song. The other three rhapsodies are hardly poetic, though vigorous and sympathetic. In the determination 'to sing a song no poet yet has chanted,' Whitman forces into his page an enumeration, of necessity fragmentary and whimsical, of the mechanical inventions and natural products of America. The result is decidedly grotesque. There is a very advanced Swedish poet of our day who has introduced 'petroleum' into his verse, but that was in singing of the French Commune, and even he, and certainly every other bardic person, small or great, would shrink from inditing such a line as:—</p><p>'Steam-power, the great express-lines, gas, petro-<br>leum .'</p><p>The catalogue of the limbs of the human body, which has been so much laughed at in Leaves of Grass, was better than this. To Whitman the world and all it contains is so ceaselessly exciting and delightful that he is willing to let any objects whatever pass before his imagination in a kind of ceaseless phantasmagoria. This, however, is not enough for a poet; he has a constructive and elective work to do. Shelley has described the poet's enjoyment in the mere lazy observation of the current facts of nature, but he has not neglected to observe that this is not in itself poetry, any more than food or even chyle is in itself blood, for he has been careful to add:—</p><p>'Out of these create he can<br>Forms more real than living man.'</p><p>It would be too much to assert that no poet will ever arise great enough to create nurselings of immortality out of the observation of such matters as express-lines, gas or petroleum, but certainly to recapitulate with emphasis the names of these things is not to produce poetry.</p><p>Space is not left us to characterise fully the 'Memoranda during the War.' They are notes, fragments, ejaculations of the most unaffected kind, and do more than any other writing to endear Whitman to us. There is something inexpressibly tender and manly in the tone of these notes; and something exceedingly stirring in the description of the alternate excitement and depression of the war-time: the pleasure in the presence around him of so many brave and handsome men, all fired with the same patriotic exaltation; the sadness of watching the deaths of so many of these in the prime of life. In the true spirit of his own passionate 'Calamus,' he wandered from tent to tent, ministering to the dying, comforting the wounded, bearing everywhere about with him that fragment of fragrant reed, that fascination of personal character, which he values so highly, and which he exercises over many who know him only through his books. From a literary point of view, his prose style may be justly criticised as heavy and disjointed, but the intrinsic interest of the story easily carries the reader above it. In some cases, as in the marvellously powerful description of the scene in the theatre when President Lincoln was shot, he is swept away into real eloquence, as in his recitatives into real poetry, by the fervour of his imagination. The ethical purpose of the book—and it is needless to say that it has one—manifestly is to exemplify in a very tragical passage of real life the possibility of carrying out that principle of sane and self-sacrificing love of comrades for one another which Whitman has so often celebrated in his most elevated and mystical utterances. It is the old story of Achilles and Patroclus transferred from windy Troy to the banks of the Potomac. It is conceivable that when all Whitman's theories about verse and democracy and religion have been rejected or have become effete, this one influence may be still at work, a permanent bequest of widened emotion to all future generations.</p><p>EDMUND W.

	"title": "Songs Oversea",
	"body": "<p><strong>SONGS OVERSEA.</strong></p><p><em>Two Rivulets</em> By Walt Whitman. Author's Edition. Camden, New Jersey, U.S.A.</p><p>It is now many years since the peace and placidity of the Republic of Letters, beginning to be shaken a little here at home by new songs of new singers, was first disturbed by the announcement of the advent of a great new poet on the other side of the Atlantic, a poet who, according to the expressions of the little band—small indeed but rapidly waxing—was to answer to the desire of one of Longfellow's prose-characters, and be the Bard of America with a song appropriate to the vastness of the subject. The poet's name was Walt Whitman, and by this magic name his faithful followers conjured until they got people to read these poems they loved so much. Then, indeed, the storm broke on the heads of the devoted adherents. The form of his song was not that to which so many centuries of European civilisation had been accustomed, therefore it was wholly unmusical, discordant, monstrous, horrible, and shapeless. But this was not all. Behind chaos came hell. The giant who broke light-hearted through the meshes of sonnet and sextain and rondel, who would have laughed with hearty Titanic laughter had he but known of them, at the quaint conceits and recipes of good Master George Puttenham for proportion poeticall, in staffe and in measure, and who recked not of lozenge or Tricquet, Pillaster, spire, sphere, or ovall, was discovered daring to speak of the body to a goodly and God-fearing generation, and for this Homeric simplicity was held as one of the company of the Arbiter or the Aretine. But, if many opposed him, many were of his party, and the most opposite and opposed schools of poetry agreed on this one point—admiration of the new master. But whether praised or blamed, Walt Whitman, with Carlyle's Danton, walked his own wild road whither it led him. But it has led him from the Pays de l'amour, and from passion of any sort, as it has led one of our own sweet chief poets, who once sang love and was cried at for singing, into the fierce arena of political struggle. In 'The Two Rivulets' will be found no stream, no little runlet, that has passed through the Eden-garden of the children of Adam, nor are the waters ruffled by any wind-blown echo of Calamus, nor does the amorous animal—man—roll on and trample down the grass-leaves. Walt Whitman's new volume consists of 'Two Rivulets,'</p><p>For the eternal ocean bound<br>These ripples, passing surges, streams of death and life,</p><p>twin channels of poetry and prose; the already familiar 'Democratic Vistas,' 'Centennial Songs,' 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions free,' 'Memoranda during War,' and 'Passage to India.' There is no need to revive here, even in slightest measure, any part of the old quarrel as to the ex-act designation suitable for such of the works of Walt Whitman as their author considers to be fitly baptised as poems. The power of the singer may be seen still vigorous in the poems 'Eidolons' and 'To a Locomotive in Winter;' the latter wonderful in its investiture of the mechanical monster with the parament of poetry and poetic thought, perhaps not wholly to be understood or appreciated except by those who have been in America; who have with it, in the 'driving snow' of 'a winter day declining,' been</p><p>Launched o'er the prairies wide—across the lakes<br>To the free skies, unpent and glad and strong.</p><p>Here, too, in the 'After the Sea-ship,' as in 'The Song of All Seas,' which concludes the series of Centennial Songs, is found evidence of the writer's strong love and feeling for the sea and for its children, the rivers and lakes, which are found at their mightiest on the American continent. And this strong love for the sea he feels for all Nature. Truly Mr. Symonds says of him in 'The Greek Poets,' 'Hopeful and fearless, accepting the world as he finds it, recognising the value of each human impulse, shirking no obligation, self-regulated by a law of perfect health, he, in the midst of a chaotic age, emerges clear and distinct, at one with nature, and therefore Greek.' It was this admiration, this passionate worship of Nature, which led to much denunciation of the worshipper; it is this which still inspires and informs his work. But the present volume is distinctly a political, a historical, or, perhaps more correctly still, a prophetic book, and it deals with and treats of the mighty future of America. Walt Whitman has been often, and with justice, compared to the painter—poet—prophet William Blake; like him he has not, it may be, obtained the recognition due to him; in this at least he suffers more than Blake, that he is better known in the land of the stranger than at home. Americans question his right to be the typical singer of America. Yet Walt Whitman has merits that no American prose-writer or poet ever yet had, with virtues and strength sufficient for claiming laureateship of the great American nation. Nothing in its way could be more splendidly dramatic and grandly descriptive than the account of the assassination of President Lincoln, one of the greatest and noblest of the central figures of modern political evolution. Space will not permit of its complete quotation from the Memoranda of the War, 'these soiled and creas'd little livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin… blotched here and there with more than one blood stain,' which are amongst the most precious of Whitman's possessions—amongst the most precious of his gifts.</p><p>After relating how it was announced that Lincoln would be at the theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, and describing the contrast of the fearful tragedy about to be performed with the nature of the performance—Our American Cousin—at which Lincoln, who enjoyed theatrical performances, was present, he proceeds:—</p><p>Through the general hum following the stage pause, with the change of positions, etc., came the muffled sound of a pistol shot which not one hundredth part of the audience heard at the time—and yet a moment's hush—somehow, surely a vague startled thrill—and then, through the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and striped space-way of the President's box, a sudden figure, a man, raises himself with hands and feet, stands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage (a distance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet), falls out of position, catching his boot-heel in the copious drapery (the American flag), falls on one knee, quickly recovers himself, rises as if nothing had happen'd (he really sprains his ankle, but unfelt then), and so the figure, Booth, the murderer, dress'd in plain black broadcloth, bareheaded, with a full head of glossy raven hair, and his eyes like some mad animal flashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange calmness, holds aloft in one hand a large knife—walks along not much back from the footlights, turns fully towards the audience his face of statuesque beauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with desperation, perhaps insanity—launches out in a firm and steady voice the words, Sic semper tyrannis —and then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage, and disappears…(Had not all this terrible scene—making the mimic ones preposterous—had it not all been rehears'd in blank, by Booth, beforehand?)</p><p>A moment's hush, incredulous—a scream—the cry of murder. Mrs. Lincoln leaning out of the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry, pointing to the retreating figure, He has killed the President… And still a moment's strange, incredulous suspense—and then the deluge!—then that mixture of horror, noises, uncertainty—the sound, somewhere back, of a horse's hoofs clattering with speed—the people burst through chairs and railings, and break them up—that noise adds to the queerness of the scene—there is inextricable confusion and terror—women faint—quite feeble persons fall and are trampled on—many cries of agony are heard—the broad stage suddenly fills to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible carnival—the audience rush generally upon it, at least the strong men do—the actors and actresses are all there in their play costumes and painted faces, with mortal fright showing through the rouge; some trembling, some in tears—the screams and calls, confused talk—redoubled, trebled—two or three manage to pass up water from the stage to the President's box—others try to clamber up, etc., etc., etc.</p><p>In the midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's Guard, with others, suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in (some two hundred altogether)—they storm the house, through all the tiers, especially the upper ones, inflamed with fury, literally charging the audience with fixed bayonets, muskets and pistols, shouting 'Clear out! clear out! you sons of———.' Such the wild scene, or a suggestion of it rather, inside the play-house that night.</p><p>. . . . . . .</p><p>And in the midst of that night-pandemonium of senseless hate, infuriated soldiers, the audience and the crowd—the stage and all its actors and actresses, its paint-pots, spangles, and gas lights—the life-blood from those veins, the best and sweetest of the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze already begins its little bubbles on the lips…. Such, hurriedly sketched, were the accompaniments of the death of President Lincoln. So suddenly, and in murder and horrors unsurpassed, he was taken from us. But his death was painless.</p><p>Such descriptive power as this would of right entitle Walt Whitman to place and name among the sons of men; and it is this, and such as this, which make the faults that must undoubtedly be admitted—among others, and perhaps most flagrant, the idle and unnecessary dislike of the poet to 'old romance,' to 'novels, plots, and plays of foreign courts,' and worst of all to 'love-verses sugar'd in rhyme'—seem comparatively unimportant. Could he apply this power to the whole as to this one chapter, Walt Whitman might abandon all other titles for that of America's first historian.</p>",

The former will be such persons as can look beneath the surface, and discern true worth under the most uncouth garb; the latter those who are content to follow the fashion, and take their opinions of poets and philosophers, as they do of bodily costume, from others. Walt Whitman's poetry is like no other that ever was written—boldly conceived, bluntly expressed, purely American yet cosmopolitan—not in the least conventional—uncramped by regular metre—disdaining to be scanned by conceited pedagogues—semi-savage yet most humane—Cyclopean in form and effect. In the book before us, his peculiar powers are exhibited in all their innate force, and the prose part is quite as original and interesting as the poetical part. There is a strange fascination about the whole, to such as are susceptible of feelings unstamped with the seal and signature of admitted authority. All others will, as we have said, declare the writer a bore, but for that there is no help. The deficiency is in them, not in him.</p>",

	"title": "The Genius of Walt Whitman",
	"body": "<p><strong>THE GENIUS OF WALT WHITMAN.</strong></p><p>———</p><p>IT is rather remarkable that Walt Whitman's last book, 'The Two Rivulets,' should have received so little recognition in this country. There has been no English edition, and so far as the present writer knows, nothing has been said about it in any of the Reviews. Yet this book contains, perhaps, the best defence of Democracy which has been offered of late years, some of the truest poetry, and not a few arrowy sayings, which, if they have not pierced the core of the great problems which have eternally troubled humanity, have at any rate penetrated them profoundly.</p><p>'The Two Rivulets' consists of prose and verse. The prose is made up of an essay called 'Democratic Vistas,' and of memoranda written during the great Civil War of the States. The author was a volunteer in the hospitals, and he tells us his experiences in the wards and in the camps. The verse, with one or two exceptions, is unmetrical and unrhymed, in the same style as the 'Leaves of Grass.' No man more clearly than Whitman has seen the seamy side of Republicanism, as it is presented in the United States. At times his faith in the people has apparently been altogether shattered, and passages might be cited which, taken by themselves, would lead us to believe that he is without hope. He sees 'the chaotic confusion of labour in the Southern States, the growing and alarming spectacle of countless squads of vagabond children, the hideousness and squalor of certain quarters of the cities; the advent of late years, with increasing frequency, of these pompous, nauseous, outside shows of vulgar wealth,' and what he calls his 'darkest dread,' the decay of the 'simple, unsophisticated conscience, the primary moral element.' 'Our triumphant modern civilisee,' he proclaims, 'with his all-schooling and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains.'</p><p>'The underlying principles of the States are not honestly believed in (for all this hectic glow and these melodramatic screamings), nor is humanity itself believed in. What penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask? The spectacle is appalling. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. The men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful superciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the littérateurs is to find something to make fun of. A lot of churches, sects, &c., the most dismal phantasms I know, usurp the name of religion. Conversation is a mass of badinage. From deceit in the spirit, the mother of all false deeds, the offspring is already incalculable. An acute and candid person in the Revenue department at Washington, who is led by the course of his employment to regularly visit the cities, north, south, and west, to investigate frauds, has talked much with me (1869, 1870) about his discoveries. The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The whole of the official services of America, national, State, and municipal, in all their branches and departments, except the Judiciary, are steeped, saturated, in corruption, bribery, falsehood, maladministrations; and the Judiciary is tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In fashionable life, flippancy, tepid amours, weak infidelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time… I say that our New World Democracy, however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic-development products, and in a certain highly deceptive, superficial, popular intellectuality, is so far an almost complete failure in its social aspects, in any superb, general-personal character, and in really grand, religious, moral, literary and æsthetic results.'</p><p>Nevertheless, on the whole, his doubts are over-mastered, and, as against any other form of government, he decides for self-government. He believes</p><p>'the ulterior object of political and all other government (having, of course, provided for the police, the safety of life, property, and for the basic statute and common law, and their administration, always first in order) to be among the rest, not merely to rule and to repress disorder, but to develop, to open up to cultivation, to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly outcroppage, and of that aspiration for independence and the pride and self-respect latent in all characters (or if there be exceptions, we cannot, fixing our eyes on them alone, make theirs the rule for all). I say the mission of government henceforth, in civilised lands, is not repression alone, and not authority alone, not even of law, nor by that favourite standard of the eminent writer (Carlyle), the rule of the best men, the born heroes and captains of the race (as if such ever, or one time out of a hundred, get into the big places, elective or dynastic!), but higher than the highest arbitrary rule, to train communities through all their grades, beginning with individuals and ending there again, to rule themselves.'</p><p>'What Christ appeared for in the moral-spiritual field for humankind—namely, that in respect to the absolute soul there is, in the possession of such by each single individual, something so transcendent, or incapable of gradations (like life), that, to that extent, it places all beings on a common level, utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect, virtue, or station, or any height or lowliness whatever, is tallied in like manner, in this other field, by Democracy's rule, that men, the nation, as a common aggregate of living identities, affording in each a separate and complete subject for freedom, worldly thrift, and happiness, and for a fair chance for growth, and for protection in citizenship, &c. must to the political extent of the suffrage or vote, if no further, be placed, in each and in the whole, on one broad, primary, universal, common platform.'</p><p>Walt Whitman's creed in this matter has been largely shaped by the war. He found the average American in the United States' armies, under pressure of want, disease, danger, and at one time in presence of failure, to be nobler than a mere glance at the outside of political life would have reported him to be. He records with joy that once, when he stood by the bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier, who lay conscious of approaching death, yet perfectly calm 'and with noble spiritual manner,' an old surgeon observed that 'he had not seen yet the first case of man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror.' He insists on the grandeur of the great uprising of the people for the sake of an idea, and the equally grand spectacle of the peaceful disbanding of the gigantic armies, and their absorption, without a word, into the ranks of the citizens. Lastly, he is convinced that, whatever follies Democracy may commit, owing mainly to its indifference, there resides in it a power of enthusiastic self-assertion on all great occasions when appeal is fairly made to it.</p><p>This is but a poor and brief account of Whitman's argument. The subject is one too large for discussion in a couple of columns; but those who care for it, if they turn to the 'Democratic Vistas,' will assuredly find that Whitman's plea is not school logic nor mere vapouring, but that it is from himself, and that every line has life in it.</p><p>After reading Whitman's poetry, we are apt to condemn nine-tenths of modern poetry as nothing but jingle. Some of his verses, like 'After the Sea Ship,' for example, are merely expressive of nature—that is to say, a natural phenomenon, commonplace enough, is selected, described, and set in a frame. But we recognise a peculiar charm—the charm of the picture, the secret of all art, and we say to ourselves, the man who takes anything which lies around us unnoticed, and holds it up to us as something worthy of admiration; who signalises its special beauty; who gives it voice; who acts as the tongue of the dumb world to us, is one of our greatest benefactors. Whitman never leaves the Present for the Past, in order to find his romance. He is utterly free from that miserable modern sentimentality which discerns nothing in our own time worth seeing, but must take all its subjects from a century, or ten centuries, or twenty centuries ago; a sentimentality morally pernicious, because, under its influence, life passes away like a dream, all the messages of the Present lying entirely disregarded. To Whitman the nineteenth century is emphatically the century for him; and he is not afraid even to write an ode to a locomotive. The poetry of the present epoch is infected with a scepticism worse than anything ever condemned by council or synod. It parades before us a weak despair, an insistence on the irreconcileable in nature, the parting of friends never to meet again, the obliteration of the landscape by the advancing ugliness of cities, the insolubility of the riddles of life, death, and the infinite. The trick, for trick it is, is easy enough. Every man with the least capacity for anything beyond the pleasures of the senses is full enough of such stuff as this; but he ought to consider himself bound not to speak it. Unless he can help his fellow creatures to courage and to faith, let him hold his tongue. Whitman refuses to be cowed even by death.</p><p>'O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?<br>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,<br>To adorn the burial house of him I love?<br>Pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,<br>With the fourth-month eve at sundown, and the grey smoke <br>lurid and bright,<br>With floods of the yellow gold, and the gorgeous, indolent, <br>sinking sun burning, expanding the air;<br>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale, green <br>leaves of the trees prolific,<br>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, <br>with a wind-dapple here and there;<br>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against <br>the sky, and shadows;<br>And the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of <br>chimneys,<br>And all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the work-<br>men homeward returning.'</p><p>He believes that thought will be its own cure; that if we are afflicted by doubt, we must not hesitate—least of all must we stop short and hide ourselves in a fiction; but that we must go forward.</p><p>'O my brave soul!<br>O farther, farther sail!<br>O daring joy, but safe! Are they not all the seas of God?<br>O farther, farther, farther sail!'</p><p>The reader of 'The Two Rivulets' will notice, what was so obvious in the Leaves of Grass, a determination to make men satisfied with their own lives. Whitman does not teach that life is to be reckoned by a few consummate moments, to which we are to look back, or for which we are to wait. He sings the sweetness of common occupations. He knows that in mere life itself there is something, there is much that is good, and that we must find our happiness in the common day's work, relationships, and visitations, unless we wish our existence to be excavated, a mere hollow reminiscence or anticipation.</p><p>Finally, he holds that it is possible for man, even in his last extremity, to preserve his serenity, and still to hope. It is almost murder to mutilate his exquisite 'Prayer of Columbus' by not quoting it entire; but nevertheless, the closing verses must be given by way of illustrating the sublimity of his faith:—</p><p>'One effort more—my altar this bleak sand;<br>That thou, O God, my life hast lighted,<br>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of thee<br>(Light rare, untellable—lighting the very light!<br>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages)!<br>For that, O God—be it my latest word,here on my knees,<br>Old, poor, and paralysed—I thank thee.</p><p>'My terminus near,<br>The clouds already closing in upon me,<br>The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,<br>I yield my ships to thee ,<br>Steersman unseen! henceforth the helms are thine;<br>Take thou command—what to my petty skill thy naviga-<br>tion?</p><p>'My hands, my limbs, grow nerveless;<br>My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd;<br>Let the old timbers part,I will not part;<br>I will cling fast to thee, O God, though the waves buffet <br>me—<br>Thee, thee, at least, I know.</p><p>'Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?<br>What do I know of life? What of myself?<br>I know not even my own work, past or present;<br>Dim, ever shifting guesses of it spread before me,<br>Of nearer, better worlds; their mighty parturition<br>Mocking, perplexing me.'</p><p>'And these things I see suddenly—what mean they?<br>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes:<br>Shadowy, vast shapes smile through the air and sky;<br>And on the distant waves sail countless ships;<br>And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.'</p><p>In this 'Prayer of Columbus' Whitman has reached the highest point of self-negation—a point which it seems sometimes impossible to attain. It is almost beyond us to be able to say: 'I am perfectly content if only the evolution goes on which my existence has helped. Whatever may happen to me—whether I live or die; whether our immortality be a truth or a figment—I am altogether resigned and happy.' It is clear that this must be the goal of our ethics; and, until we have overcome even to that end, we shall be the victims of unceasing despairs. Till then we build on illusions, which for a moment seem to possess reality, and presently vanish, mocking our hopes.</p><p>If a motto were to be chosen for 'The Two Rivulets,' and for Walt Whitman generally, it should be that noble sentence from the preface to 'The Hesperus' of Jean Paul:—</p><p>'The stones and rocks, which two veiled shapes, necessity and sin, like Deucalion and Pyrrha, throw behind them at the good, shall become new men.</p><p>'And on the western gate of this century stands written:</p><p>'Here is the road to Virtue and Wisdom.'</p><p>Just as on the western gate of Cherson stood the sublime inscription—</p><p>'Here leads the way to Byzantium.</p><p>Infinite Providence, thou wilt make the day dawn.''</p><p>W.
